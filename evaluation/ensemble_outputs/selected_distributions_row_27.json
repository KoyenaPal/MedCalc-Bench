        "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient's blood pressure is given as 178/100 mm Hg. I need to find the mean arterial pressure (MAP). From what I remember, the formula for MAP is either the diastolic plus one-third of the pulse pressure or (2D + P)/3, where D is diastolic and P is systolic. Wait, let me get that right.\n\nSo the standard formula is MAP \u2248 Diastolic + (Systolic - Diastolic)/3. Alternatively, it can also be calculated as (2/3 \u00d7 Di",

I remember that MAP is calculated using the systolic and diastolic pressures. But wait, what's the exact formula again? Hmm.\n\nRight, the formula for mean arterial pressure is typically (Diastolic BP) + 1/3*(Systolic BP - Diastolic BP). Alternatively, sometimes it's approximated as (2 * Diastolic + Systolic)/3.
