        " correct. \n\nSo the final answer is 6657 mg, but since MME is usually rounded to the nearest whole number, it would be 6657 mg. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects to use a different conversion for the Fentanyl patch. Let me see if there's another common conversion. \n\nAnother source says that Fentanyl transdermal can be converted to MME by multiplying by 10 (so 1 mg Fentanyl patch = 10 mg oral morphine). \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then for 60 mg patch every 3 days:\n\nTotal daily dose from",
        " correct. \n\nSo the calculation must be as above. \n\nThe extremely high MME is due to the Fentanyl buccal doses. 30 mg twice a day is a very high dose, but per the conversion, that's how it is. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 6657 mg MME per day.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"First, calculate each medication's contribution to MME using conversion factors:\\n\\n1. **Fentanyl Patch (60 mg every 72 hours):**\\n   - Convert to mcg/hour: (6",
