        "Step 1: Understand the problem. We need to calculate the corrected QT interval using the Framingham Formula. The formula is given by:\n\nCorrected QT (QTc) = QT Interval + (heart rate - 60) * (QT interval / 60)\n\nBut there seems to be some confusion. The commonly used formula to correct QT intervals is actually the Bazett's formula, or possibly the Framingham, Fridericia, or other formulas. I believe the most common formula used for the correction of the QT interval is Bazett's formula, which is given by:\n\nQTc_Bazett = QT / \ufffd"

        "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a patient note with a heart rate of 144 bpm and a QT interval of 330 msec. The task is to use the Framingham Formula to calculate the corrected QT interval.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the Framingham Formula. From what I remember, the formula is used to adjust the QT interval based on the heart rate. The standard formula I know is something like QTc = QT + (0.154 \u00d7 (HR^\u22120.5)). Wait, but I should make sure I'm not confusing it with other",
