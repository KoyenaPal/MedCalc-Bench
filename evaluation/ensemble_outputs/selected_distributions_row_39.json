Since it's not given, we cannot calculate the maintenance fluids based on weight.\n\nHowever, if we assume this is an oversight and we need to use a standard approach for estimating maintenance fluids, we typically use the patient's weight to calculate the basal or maintenance fluids.\n\nThe standard formula for calculating the maintenance fluid",

To do this, we can use the common formula for maintenance fluids which is dependent on the patient's weight.
