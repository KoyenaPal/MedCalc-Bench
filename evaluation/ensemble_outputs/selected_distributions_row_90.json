From what I remember, the formula for mean arterial pressure is generally considered to be:\n\nMAP = (Diastolic BP + 2 \u00d7 Systolic BP) / 3\n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's approximated as Diastolic + (Systolic - Diastolic)/3, but both formulas should give the same result. Let me double-check that. Yes, expanding the second formula gives the same as the first. So",
