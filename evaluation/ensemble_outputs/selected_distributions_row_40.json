From what I recall, the GCS is based on three components: Eye Opening, Verbal Response, and Motor Response. Each component is scored individually and then summed up.\n\nLooking at the patient note, let me parse the information step by step. The patient was found unconscious and brought to the ED. Vital signs are normal, but that's probably not directly relevant to GCS. The key part here is",

The GCS is a scale used to assess the level of consciousness and is scored from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating more severe impairment. It's broken down into three components: Eye Opening (E), Verbal Response (V), and Motor Response (M). Each component is scored separately and then summed.\n\nFirst, let me go through the patient note again to extract the relevant information. The patient was found unconscious and brought to"
