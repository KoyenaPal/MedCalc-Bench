The user wants to find the estimated date of conception based on the last menstrual period (LMP) and cycle length.\n\nFirst, I remember that typically, pregnancy is calculated starting from the first day of the LMP.

But conception usually occurs about two weeks after the LMP, right? Because ovulation typically happens around day 14 of a 28-day cycle.
