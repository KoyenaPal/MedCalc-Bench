The first calculation on day 36 gives approximately 0.15, which is the higher of the two. The question might expect the first instance when the delta ratio was calculated. Alternatively, perhaps they want the value at discharge or another point. Let me check the note again. The liver biopsy was done on day 36, so that's when the diagnosis was made. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 0"
