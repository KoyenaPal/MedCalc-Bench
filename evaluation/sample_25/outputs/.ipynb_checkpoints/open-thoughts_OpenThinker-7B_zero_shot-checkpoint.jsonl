{"Row Number": 353, "Calculator Name": "HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk", "Calculator ID": "25", "Category": "risk", "Note ID": "10", "Patient Note": "A 72-year-old man finds himself back at the primary care clinic for his routine visit. His well-documented history of uncontrolled hypertension is a notable element in his case file. However, there is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. He admits to patronizing alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. Also noteworthy in his medical history are his liver and renal conditions. On the one hand, he has had numerous hospital admissions over the years with repeated indications of hepatic impairment due to ALD. His renal function has also been a concern, as demonstrated by an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Contrarily, when it comes to bleeding risk, he has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding. His coagulation profiles are quite stable, demonstrated by a consistently normal international normalized ratio (INR). These medical intricacies necessitate a comprehensive, focused approach to his healthcare management.", "Question": "What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?", "LLM Answer": "name 'N' is not defined", "LLM Explanation": "name 'N' is not defined", "LLM Thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to calculate the HAS-BLED score for this patient. Hmm, first, what exactly is the HAS-BLED score? Oh right, it's a tool used to assess the risk of major bleeding in patients on anticoagulants. The acronym stands for H, A, S, B, L, E, D. Each letter corresponds to a specific factor. Let me recall each component. So, H stands for Hypertension. The patient has uncontrolled hypertension. The criteria here might be if systolic BP is \u2265160 mmHg or diastolic \u2265100 mmHg, or if they're on antihypertensive therapy but not controlled. The note says his hypertension is uncontrolled, so that's probably a yes. So H gets +1. Next, A is Abnormal Renal Function. The patient has renal impairment indicated by elevated creatinine and reduced GFR. The threshold here is serum creatinine \u22651.5 mg/dL in men or \u22651.4 mg/dL in women. The note mentions elevated creatinine and reduced GFR, which would meet this criterion. So A adds +1. S is Abnormal Liver Function. The patient has hepatic impairment due to ALD (alcoholic liver disease). The criteria here is INR \u22651.5 or albumin <35 g/L. The note says coagulation profiles are stable with normal INR, but does mention liver conditions. Wait, maybe the liver function isn't explicitly stated here. The note says his renal function is a concern, but liver function might be part of the ALD diagnosis. Since he has ALD leading to hepatic impairment, even if INR is normal, maybe the liver function is abnormal. But the exact criteria for S in HAS-BLED is INR \u22651.5 or albumin <35. The note doesn't mention albumin levels. Hmm. The patient's renal function is a concern, but liver function isn't explicitly stated. Maybe we can assume that since he has ALD, his liver function is impaired, but without specific numbers, maybe we can't count this. Wait, the note says \"his liver and renal conditions\" are concerns. For S, it's either INR \u22651.5 or albumin <35. Since INR is normal (as per coagulation profiles being stable with normal INR), and albumin isn't mentioned, perhaps S is not applicable here. So S would be 0. B is Bleeding History. The patient has no suggestion of a previous stroke, but does he have a bleeding history? The note says there's no suggestion of a previous stroke, but does it mention any bleeding episodes? It just says he hasn't been prescribed any bleeding-accelerating meds. So B would be 0. L is Laboratory Abnormalities. This includes platelet count <100 \u00d710^9/L, or low vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. The note says coagulation profiles are stable with normal INR. Platelets aren't mentioned. If platelets are within normal range, then L is 0. Unless there's another lab abnormality, but the note doesn't specify. So L is 0. E is Elderly. The patient is 72 years old. The HAS-BLED uses age \u226565 as a factor. So E adds +1. D is Drugs/Diseases. This includes use of drugs like NSAIDs, corticosteroids, antiplatelets, or diseases like cancer. The patient uses alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. Alcohol itself is considered a risk factor here. The note mentions patronizing alcohol, which is a risk factor for bleeding. So D adds +1. Wait, but the D factor in HAS-BLED is for drugs or diseases that increase bleeding risk. Alcohol abuse is a recognized risk factor, so that would contribute +1. So D is +1. Now, adding up all the components: H:1, A:1, S:0, B:0, L:0, E:1, D:1. Total is 1+1+0+0+0+1+1=4. But wait, let me double-check each component again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Hypertension: Uncontrolled, so yes. Correct. Abnormal renal function: Elevated creatinine and reduced GFR. That's a yes. Correct. Liver function: The note mentions hepatic impairment from ALD, but without INR or albumin data, maybe it's not counted. So S remains 0. Bleeding history: No previous stroke, no bleeding episodes. So B is 0. Lab abnormalities: Normal INR, no mention of platelets or clotting factors. So L is 0. Elderly: 72 is over 65, so yes. Correct. Drugs/diseases: Alcohol use is a risk factor. So D is +1. Total: 1+1+0+0+0+1+1=4. So the HAS-BLED score is 4. ", "Ground Truth Answer": "5", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current HAS-BLED score is 0.\nThe patient is 72.0 years old. Because the patient's age is greater than 65 years, we increment the score by 1, making the current score 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient has 9 drinks a week. Because the patient has at least 8 alcoholic drinks a week, we increment the score by 1, making the current score 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe issue, hypertension, is reported to be present for the patient note and so we increase the score by 1, making the current score 2 + 1 = 3.\nThe issue, liver disease, is reported to be present for the patient note and so we increase the score by 1, making the current score 3 + 1 = 4.\nThe issue, renal disease, is reported to be present for the patient note and so we increase the score by 1, making the current score 4 + 1 = 5.\nThe issue, stroke history, is reported to be absent for the patient and so we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 5.\nThe issue, prior bleeding, is missing from the patient note and so we assume it to be absent and so we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 5.\nThe issue, labile inr, is reported to be absent for the patient and so we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 5.\nThe issue, medications for bleeding, is reported to be absent for the patient and so we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 5.\nHence, the patient's HAS-BLED score is 5.", "Result": "Incorrect"}
