The Framingham Risk Score is used to estimate the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). The key factors required for the calculation include: - Age - Sex - Total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - Systolic blood pressure - Whether the patient is on blood pressure medication - Whether the patient is a smoker - Whether the patient has diabetes Let's gather the information from the patient note step-by-step: 1. **Age**: The patient is 50 years old. 2. **Sex**: Male. 3. **Total Cholesterol**: Not directly provided. We have LDL (107 mg/dL), HDL (43 mg/dL), and triglycerides (98 mg/dL). We can estimate the total cholesterol using the formula: Total Cholesterol \u2248 LDL + HDL + (Triglycerides / 5). Using the given values: Total Cholesterol \u2248 107 + 43 + (98 / 5) = 107 + 43 + 19.6 = 169.6 mg/dL. We'll round this to 170 mg/dL for simplicity. 4. **HDL Cholesterol**: 43 mg/dL. 5. **Systolic Blood Pressure**: The blood pressure on presentation was 131/83 mm Hg, so the systolic blood pressure is 131 mm Hg. 6. **Blood Pressure Medication**: There is no mention of the patient being on blood pressure medication. 7. **Smoking Status**: The patient has a 3-pack year smoking history. This indicates that he is a smoker or has a history of smoking. However, the current smoking status isn't explicitly mentioned. Since the note doesn't state that the patient has quit smoking, we will assume he is a current smoker. 8. **Diabetes**: The patient has no history of diabetes. Now we have the following data for the Framingham Risk Score calculation: - Age: 50 years - Sex: Male - Total Cholesterol: 170 mg/dL - HDL Cholesterol: 43 mg/dL - Systolic Blood Pressure: 131 mm Hg - On Blood Pressure Medication: No - Smoker: Yes - Diabetes: No We will use the Framingham Risk Score formula for men: The formula involves several points assigned to different risk factors: - Age - Total Cholesterol - HDL Cholesterol - Systolic Blood Pressure - Treatment for hypertension (if any) - Smoking status - Diabetes Let's calculate the points for each factor: 1. **Age**: For a 50-year-old male, the points are 9. 2. **Total Cholesterol (mg/dL)**: - 170 mg/dL falls into the range of 160-199 mg/dL, which corresponds to 3 points. 3. **HDL Cholesterol (mg/dL)**: - 43 mg/dL falls into the range of 30-39 mg/dL, which corresponds to 3 points. 4. **Systolic Blood Pressure (mm Hg)**: - The systolic blood pressure is 131 mm Hg. Since the patient is not on blood pressure medication, we use the systolic blood pressure directly. - 130-139 mm Hg corresponds to 4 points. 5. **Treatment for Hypertension**: - The patient is not on blood pressure medication, so this is 0 points. 6. **Smoking Status**: - The patient is a smoker, so this is 2 points. 7. **Diabetes**: - The patient does not have diabetes, so this is 0 points.

The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.", "Question": "Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "LLM Answer": "7.61", "LLM Explanation": "To calculate the patient's GFR using the 2009 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, we first convert the serum creatinine from mg/dL to \u03bcmol/L.

Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0\u20139 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90\u2013180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10\u201340 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0\u20130.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0\u20130.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.", "Question": "Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.\nFrom February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment.

The patient's height is 160 cm and weight is 56.8 kg. We first convert the height to inches: 160 cm / 2.54 cm/inch \u2248 62.99 inches. The inches above 5 feet (60 inches) is 2.99 inches. Using the ideal body weight formula for men: Ideal Body Weight = 50 kg + 2.3 kg/inch * 2.99 inches \u2248 50 kg + 6.877 kg \u2248 56.877 kg. Now we use the adjusted body weight formula: Adjusted Body Weight = Ideal Body Weight + 0.4 * (Actual Body Weight - Ideal Body Weight). Substituting the values, we get: Adjusted Body Weight = 56.877 kg + 0.4 * (56.8 kg - 56.877 kg). Calculating the difference: 56.8 kg - 56.877 kg = -0.077 kg. Then, 0.4 * (-0.077 kg) = -0.0308 kg. Therefore, Adjusted Body Weight = 56.877 kg - 0.0308 kg \u2248 56.8462 kg, which rounds to approximately 56.85 kg.

The range within 20% of the ideal body weight is from approximately 45.5016 kg to 68.2524 kg.

The patient's height is 160 cm and weight is 56.8 kg. The formula for adjusted body weight is typically used in the context of calculating medication dosages and is often used for patients who are either overweight or underweight. The formula for adjusted body weight is: Adjusted Body Weight = Ideal Body Weight + 0.4 * (Actual Body Weight - Ideal Body Weight) To use this formula, we first need to calculate the ideal body weight. The ideal body weight for men can be calculated using the following formula: Ideal Body Weight (IBW) = 50 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch above 5 feet. However, since the height is given in centimeters, we should convert the height to inches first. 1 inch = 2.54 cm. So, the patient's height in inches is: \\[ \\text{Height in inches} = \\frac{160 \\, \\text{cm}}{2.54 \\, \\text{cm/inch}} \\approx 62.99 \\, \\text{inches}. \\] Since the ideal body weight formula uses height in inches and starts from 5 feet (which is 60 inches), we need to calculate how many inches above 5 feet the patient is: \\[ \\text{Inches above 5 feet} = 62.99 \\, \\text{inches} - 60 \\, \\text{inches} = 2.99 \\, \\text{inches}. \\] Now we can calculate the ideal body weight using the formula: \\[ \\text{Ideal Body Weight} = 50 \\, \\text{kg} + 2.3 \\, \\text{kg/inch} \\times 2.99 \\, \\text{inches}. \\] Let's calculate this step by step: \\[ 2.3 \\, \\text{kg/inch} \\times 2.99 \\, \\text{inches} \\approx 6.877 \\, \\text{kg}. \\] So, \\[ \\text{Ideal Body Weight} = 50 \\, \\text{kg} + 6.877 \\, \\text{kg} \\approx 56.877 \\, \\text{kg}. \\] Now we have the ideal body weight (approximately 56.877 kg) and the actual body weight (56.8 kg).

Upper limit = Ideal Body Weight + 20% of Ideal Body Weight = 56.877 kg + 11.3754 kg \u2248 68.2524 kg. The patient's actual weight is 56.8 kg. Since 56.8 kg falls within the range of approximately 45.5016 kg to 68.2524 kg, the patient's weight is within 20% of the ideal body weight.

The patient takes 1 doses/day of OxyCODONE. This means that the patient takes 60 mg/dose OxyCODONE * 1 dose/day = 60 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of OxyCODONE, multiply the 60 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 1.5 mme/mg, giving us 90.0 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of OxyCODONE to the total mme/day gives us 0 + 90.0 = 90.0 mme/day.\nThe patient's dose of HYDROmorphone is 70 mg. The patient takes 2 doses/day of HYDROmorphone. This means that the patient takes 70 mg/dose HYDROmorphone * 2 dose/day = 140 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of HYDROmorphone, multiply the 140 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 5 mme/mg, giving us 700 mme/day.

She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.\nEven after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic\u2013clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett\u2019s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ).

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol.
