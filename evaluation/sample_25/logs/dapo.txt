 Here is the patient note:
A 72-year-old man finds himself back at the primary care clinic for his routine visit. His well-documented history of uncontrolled hypertension is a notable element in his case file. However, there is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. He admits to patronizing alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. Also noteworthy in his medical history are his liver and renal conditions. On the one hand, he has had numerous hospital admissions over the years with repeated indications of hepatic impairment due to ALD. His renal function has also been a concern, as demonstrated by an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Contrarily, when it comes to bleeding risk, he has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding. His coagulation profiles are quite stable, demonstrated by a consistently normal international normalized ratio (INR). These medical intricacies necessitate a comprehensive, focused approach to his healthcare management.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?

 Here is the patient note:
A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive retrosternal chest pain. His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.
On presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.
The patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.
An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.
The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().
A peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for myelodysplastic syndrome was also negative.

The Framingham Risk Score is used to estimate the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). The key factors required for the calculation include: - Age - Sex - Total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - Systolic blood pressure - Whether the patient is on blood pressure medication - Whether the patient is a smoker - Whether the patient has diabetes Let's gather the information from the patient note step-by-step: 1. **Age**: The patient is 50 years old. 2. **Sex**: Male. 3. **Total Cholesterol**: Not directly provided. We have LDL (107 mg/dL), HDL (43 mg/dL), and triglycerides (98 mg/dL). We can estimate the total cholesterol using the formula: Total Cholesterol ≈ LDL + HDL + (Triglycerides / 5). Using the given values: Total Cholesterol ≈ 107 + 43 + (98 / 5) = 107 + 43 + 19.6 = 169.6 mg/dL. We'll round this to 170 mg/dL for simplicity. 4. **HDL Cholesterol**: 43 mg/dL. 5. **Systolic Blood Pressure**: The blood pressure on presentation was 131/83 mm Hg, so the systolic blood pressure is 131 mm Hg. 6. **Blood Pressure Medication**: There is no mention of the patient being on blood pressure medication. 7. **Smoking Status**: The patient has a 3-pack year smoking history. This indicates that he is a smoker or has a history of smoking. However, the current smoking status isn't explicitly mentioned. Since the note doesn't state that the patient has quit smoking, we will assume he is a current smoker. 8. **Diabetes**: The patient has no history of diabetes. Now we have the following data for the Framingham Risk Score calculation: - Age: 50 years - Sex: Male - Total Cholesterol: 170 mg/dL - HDL Cholesterol: 43 mg/dL - Systolic Blood Pressure: 131 mm Hg - On Blood Pressure Medication: No - Smoker: Yes - Diabetes: No We will use the Framingham Risk Score formula for men: The formula involves several points assigned to different risk factors: - Age - Total Cholesterol - HDL Cholesterol - Systolic Blood Pressure - Treatment for hypertension (if any) - Smoking status - Diabetes Let's calculate the points for each factor: 1. **Age**: For a 50-year-old male, the points are 9. 2. **Total Cholesterol (mg/dL)**: - 170 mg/dL falls into the range of 160-199 mg/dL, which corresponds to 3 points. 3. **HDL Cholesterol (mg/dL)**: - 43 mg/dL falls into the range of 30-39 mg/dL, which corresponds to 3 points. 4. **Systolic Blood Pressure (mm Hg)**: - The systolic blood pressure is 131 mm Hg. Since the patient is not on blood pressure medication, we use the systolic blood pressure directly. - 130-139 mm Hg corresponds to 4 points. 5. **Treatment for Hypertension**: - The patient is not on blood pressure medication, so this is 0 points. 6. **Smoking Status**: - The patient is a smoker, so this is 2 points. 7. **Diabetes**: - The patient does not have diabetes, so this is 0 points. Now, let's add up all the points: - Age: 9 points - Total Cholesterol: 3 points - HDL Cholesterol: 3 points - Systolic Blood Pressure: 4 points - Treatment for Hypertension: 0 points - Smoking Status: 2 points - Diabetes: 0 points Total points = 9 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 21 points. To convert these points into a 10-year risk percentage, we use the following table or formula for men: For 21 points, the corresponding 10-year risk of developing CHD is approximately 10-11%. However, for a more precise calculation, we can use the Framingham Risk Score table or calculator. According to the Framingham Risk Score tables: - 21 points correspond to a 10-year risk of approximately 10%.

 To calculate the patient's Framingham Risk Score, we need to gather the necessary information from the patient note. The Framingham Risk Score is used to estimate the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). The key factors required for the calculation include: - Age - Sex - Total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - Systolic blood pressure - Whether the patient is on blood pressure medication - Whether the patient is a smoker - Whether the patient has diabetes Let's gather the information from the patient note step-by-step: 1. **Age**: The patient is 50 years old. 2. **Sex**: Male. 3. **Total Cholesterol**: Not directly provided. We have LDL (107 mg/dL), HDL (43 mg/dL), and triglycerides (98 mg/dL). We can estimate the total cholesterol using the formula: Total Cholesterol ≈ LDL + HDL + (Triglycerides / 5). Using the given values: Total Cholesterol ≈ 107 + 43 + (98 / 5) = 107 + 43 + 19.6 = 169.6 mg/dL. We'll round this to 170 mg/dL for simplicity. 4. **HDL Cholesterol**: 43 mg/dL. 5. **Systolic Blood Pressure**: The blood pressure on presentation was 131/83 mm Hg, so the systolic blood pressure is 131 mm Hg. 6. **Blood Pressure Medication**: There is no mention of the patient being on blood pressure medication. 7. **Smoking Status**: The patient has a 3-pack year smoking history. This indicates that he is a smoker or has a history of smoking. However, the current smoking status isn't explicitly mentioned. Since the note doesn't state that the patient has quit smoking, we will assume he is a current smoker. 8. **Diabetes**: The patient has no history of diabetes. Now we have the following data for the Framingham Risk Score calculation: - Age: 50 years - Sex: Male - Total Cholesterol: 170 mg/dL - HDL Cholesterol: 43 mg/dL - Systolic Blood Pressure: 131 mm Hg - On Blood Pressure Medication: No - Smoker: Yes - Diabetes: No We will use the Framingham Risk Score formula for men: The formula involves several points assigned to different risk factors: - Age - Total Cholesterol - HDL Cholesterol - Systolic Blood Pressure - Treatment for hypertension (if any) - Smoking status - Diabetes Let's calculate the points for each factor: 1. **Age**: For a 50-year-old male, the points are 9. 2. **Total Cholesterol (mg/dL)**: - 170 mg/dL falls into the range of 160-199 mg/dL, which corresponds to 3 points. 3. **HDL Cholesterol (mg/dL)**: - 43 mg/dL falls into the range of 30-39 mg/dL, which corresponds to 3 points. 4. **Systolic Blood Pressure (mm Hg)**: - The systolic blood pressure is 131 mm Hg. Since the patient is not on blood pressure medication, we use the systolic blood pressure directly. - 130-139 mm Hg corresponds to 4 points. 5. **Treatment for Hypertension**: - The patient is not on blood pressure medication, so this is 0 points. 6. **Smoking Status**: - The patient is a smoker, so this is 2 points. 7. **Diabetes**: - The patient does not have diabetes, so this is 0 points. Now, let's add up all the points: - Age: 9 points - Total Cholesterol: 3 points - HDL Cholesterol: 3 points - Systolic Blood Pressure: 4 points - Treatment for Hypertension: 0 points - Smoking Status: 2 points - Diabetes: 0 points Total points = 9 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 21 points. To convert these points into a 10-year risk percentage, we use the following table or formula for men: For 21 points, the corresponding 10-year risk of developing CHD is approximately 10-11%. However, for a more precise calculation, we can use the Framingham Risk Score table or calculator. According to the Framingham Risk Score tables: - 21 points correspond to a 10-year risk of approximately 10%. Thus, the patient's Framingham Risk Score is approximately 10%.

His medical history was significant only for acute diverticulitis one year prior to current presentation and a 3-pack year smoking history. He had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. He denied personal or family history of cardiovascular diseases, hypercoagulable states, or bleeding disorders. A review of systems was negative for headache, visual disturbances, pruritus, easy bruising, or erythromelalgia.\nOn presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg and heart rate was 84 beats/minute. He was in moderate distress due to pain. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds. Cardiac exam was unremarkable. No hepatosplenomegaly was detected on palpation. There was no erythema or rash on skin exam.\nThe patient's initial CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 14.6 g/dL, hematocrit 43.9%, WBC count 13,100/mm3, and platelet count 1,026,000/mm3. During his previous emergency department visit for acute diverticulitis, his platelet count was 976,000/mm3. This was felt to be reactive due to acute inflammation, and he was discharged on a course of oral antibiotics. He had no subsequent outpatient follow-up.\nAn electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversions in leads III and aVF (). His initial troponin I was 0.15 ng/mL. A repeat level 6 hours later increased to 2.83 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia. His LDL was 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL, and triglycerides 98 mg/dL. His electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and liver enzymes were within normal limits.\nThe patient was transferred to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. A cardiac catheterization revealed a thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a 60% stenosis and a TIMI Grade II flow (). No percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed due to a perceived high risk of complications, specifically distal embolization, given the high platelet count. The patient was treated with aspirin 81 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and hydroxyurea 1,000 mg every 12 hours. Four days later, a repeat cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries with dissolution of the previously found RCA thrombus and no underlying atherosclerotic plaques ().\nA peripheral blood smear was significant for marked thrombocytosis without an increase in immature myeloid elements. Molecular studies were negative for JAK2 mutations in V617F and exon 12 and positive for a CALR mutation type 1 (del52). Testing for BCR/ABL translocations was negative. Hence, a diagnosis of ET was made on the basis of the clinical presentation, consistently high platelet count, and presence of a clonal marker.\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on hydroxyurea and low-dose aspirin. His platelet count on discharge was 821,000/mm3. Two months later, his platelet count normalized to 320,000/mm3. He continued to do well with no further thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. A bone marrow biopsy then was hypocellular and revealed no fibrosis, dysplastic changes, or increase in blasts.

", 'Ground Truth Answer': '0', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The patient's gender is Male.\nFor males, the formula for computing the framingham risk score is 52.00961 * ln(age) + 20.014077 * ln(total_cholestrol) + -0.905964 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 1.305784 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.241549 * bp_medicine + 12.096316 * smoker + -4.605038 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.84367 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker + -2.93323 * ln(age) * ln(age) -  172.300168, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not.\nFrom this, we use the risk score to get likelihood for a patient getting myocardial infraction (MI) or dying in the next 10 years: 1 - 0.9402^exp(risk_score), where risk_score is the value from the formula above.\nThe patient is 50 years old. The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}

Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the parameters from the patient note. - Age: 60 years old. - Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 14. - Body Temperature: 37.2°C. - Blood Pressure: 135/75 mm Hg. We need to calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). The formula for MAP is: MAP = (2 * Diastolic + Systolic) / 3. So, MAP = (2 * 75 + 135) / 3 = (150 + 135) / 3 = 285 / 3 = 95 mm Hg. - Respiratory Rate: 19 breaths per minute. - White Blood Cell (WBC) count: 12,000 per µL. - Hematocrit: 43%. - Sodium: 138 mEq/L. - Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L. - Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL. - A-a gradient: 364 mm Hg with FiO₂ of 55%. Step 2: Calculate the APACHE II score for each parameter. 1. Age: - The patient is 60 years old. The age score is as follows: - 1 point for 16-44 years. - 2 points for 45-54 years. - 3 points for 55-64 years. - 4 points for 65-74 years. - 5 points for 75 years and above. Since the patient is 60 years old, the age score is 3 points. 2. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): The GCS score is 14. The APACHE II scoring for GCS is: - 1 point for GCS 15. - 2 points for GCS 13-14. - 3 points for GCS 10-12. - 4 points for GCS 5-9. - 5 points for GCS 3-4. - 6 points for GCS 1-2. Since the GCS is 14, the score is 2 points. 3. Body Temperature: The body temperature is 37.2°C. The APACHE II scoring for temperature is: - 0 points for 36.0-38.0°C. - 1 point for <36.0°C or >38.0°C. Since the temperature is 37.2°C, which falls within the range of 36.0-38.0°C, the score is 0 points. 4. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): The MAP is 95 mm Hg. The APACHE II scoring for MAP is: - 0 points for 70-110 mm Hg. - 1 point for 50-69 mm Hg or 111-139 mm Hg. - 2 points for <50 mm Hg or 140-169 mm Hg. - 3 points for >170 mm Hg. Since the MAP is 95 mm Hg, which falls within the range of 70-110 mm Hg, the score is 0 points. 5. Respiratory Rate or PaCO₂: The respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute. We also have information about the A-a gradient and FiO₂, which can help us calculate the PaO₂ and use it to find the PaCO₂ if needed. However, since the respiratory rate is within the normal range (typically 12-20 breaths per minute), we will use the respiratory rate to calculate the score. The APACHE II scoring for respiratory rate is: - 0 points for 12-20 breaths/min. - 1 point for 10-11 or 21-24 breaths/min. - 2 points for 6-9 or 25-30 breaths/min. - 3 points for <6 or >30 breaths/min. Since the respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, which falls within the range of 12-20 breaths/min, the score is 0 points. Alternatively, if we use the A-a gradient and FiO₂ to calculate the PaO₂ score, the formula for the A-a gradient is: \[ \text{A-a gradient} = \text{PaO₂} - \text{(FiO₂ * 760 - PaCO₂ * 1.25)} \] However, since the A-a gradient is given as 364 mm Hg and FiO₂ is 55%, we can use the A-a gradient directly to calculate the PaO₂ score. The APACHE II scoring for PaO₂ is based on the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio. The A-a gradient is given as 364 mm Hg, and FiO₂ is 55%. Let's calculate the PaO₂ using the A-a gradient formula rearranged to solve for PaO₂: \[ \text{A-a gradient} = \text{PaO₂} - \left(\text{FiO₂ * 760} - \text{PaCO₂ * 1.25}\right) \] Given: - A-a gradient = 364 mm Hg - FiO₂ = 0.55 - Let's assume a normal PaCO₂ value of approximately 40 mm Hg for this calculation. So, \[ 364 = \text{PaO₂} - \left(0.55 * 760 - 40 * 1.25\right) \] Calculate \(0.55 * 760\): \[ 0.55 * 760 = 418 \] Calculate \(40 * 1.25\): \[ 40 * 1.25 = 50 \] Now plug these values into the equation: \[ 364 = \text{PaO₂} - (418 - 50) \] \[ 364 = \text{PaO₂} - 368 \] \[ \text{PaO₂} = 364 + 368 \] \[ \text{PaO₂} = 732 \, \text{mm Hg} \] This seems incorrect because the PaO₂ value is unrealistically high. Let's try another approach by using the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio directly. The A-a gradient is given as 364 mm Hg, and the FiO₂ is 55%. The A-a gradient is defined as: \[ \text{A-a gradient} = \text{Alveolar O₂ tension (PAO₂)} - \text{Arterial O₂ tension (PaO₂)} \] Using the alveolar gas equation to find PAO₂: \[ \text{PAO₂} = \text{FiO₂ * (PB - PH₂O)} - \left(\frac{\text{PaCO₂}}{R}\right) \] Where: - PB is the barometric pressure (approximately 760 mm Hg at sea level). - PH₂O is the water vapor pressure (approximately 47 mm Hg). - PaCO₂ is the arterial partial pressure of CO₂ (we'll assume a normal value of 40 mm Hg). - R is the respiratory quotient, typically taken as 0.8. So, \[ \text{PAO₂} = 0.55 * (760 - 47) - \left(\frac{40}{0.8}\right) \] \[ \text{PAO₂} = 0.55 * 713 - 50 \] \[ \text{PAO₂} = 392.15 - 50 \] \[ \text{PAO₂} = 342.15 \, \text{mm Hg} \] Now, using the A-a gradient: \[ \text{A-a gradient} = \text{PAO₂} - \text{PaO₂} \] \[ 364 = 342.15 - \text{PaO₂} \] \[ \text{PaO₂} = 342.15 - 364 \] \[ \text{PaO₂} = -21.85 \] This result is also unrealistic because PaO₂ cannot be negative. It seems there might be an error in the given A-a gradient or the context of the problem. Let's use the respiratory rate for scoring since it is within the normal range. So the score for respiratory rate is 0 points. 6. White Blood Cell (WBC) count: The WBC count is 12,000 per µL. The APACHE II scoring for WBC is: - 0 points for 4-13.9 x 10^9/L. - 1 point for 14-29.9 x 10^9/L or 1-3.9 x 10^9/L. - 2 points for >30 x 10^9/L or <1 x 10^9/L. Since 12,000 per µL is equal to 12 x 10^3/µL = 12 x 10^3 * 10^-3 x 10^9/L = 12 x 10^6/L = 12 x 10^3/µL = 12 x 10^3 * 10^-3 x 10^9/L = 12 x 10^6/L = 12 x 10^3/µL = 12 x 10^3 * 10^-3 x 10^9/L = 12 x 10^6/L = 12 x 10^3/µL = 12 x 10^3 * 10^-3 x 10^9/L = 12 x 10^6/L. It seems I made an error in the conversion.

A 38-year-old female was admitted to the emergency ward with altered sensorium and anuria. She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.
It is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.
A trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.
On performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.
The patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone. After that, the patient was on maintenance therapy with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/body weight) at least for 12 months and advised for monthly follow-up.

We need to calculate the patient's GFR using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation. The 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation is not the one we typically use; it seems there might be some confusion. The standard 2021 CKD-EPI equation incorporates both creatinine and cystatin C, but since the patient note only provides creatinine levels, we will use the 2009 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation. The 2009 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation is: \[ \text{GFR (mL/min/1.73 m}^2\text{)} = 144 \times \left(\frac{\text{Creatinine}}{0.7}\right)^{-0.329} \times 0.993^{\text{age}} \] If the patient is female, we multiply the result by 1.018. However, the patient's serum creatinine level is given as 8.9 mg/dL. We need to convert this to micromoles per liter (μmol/L) because the CKD-EPI equation uses μmol/L for creatinine. The conversion factor from mg/dL to μmol/L for creatinine is approximately 88.4. So, \[ \text{Creatinine in μmol/L} = 8.9 \, \text{mg/dL} \times 88.4 = 786.76 \, \mu\text{mol/L}. \] Now, let's use the 2009 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation for a female patient. The equation is: \[ \text{GFR} = 144 \times \left(\frac{\text{Creatinine}}{0.7}\right)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{\text{age}} \times 1.018. \] Given: - Creatinine = 786.76 μmol/L. - Age = 38 years. - The patient is female. Let's plug in the values. First, we need to convert the creatinine value to the form used in the equation. The reference value for creatinine in the equation is 0.7 mg/dL, which we need to convert to μmol/L: \[ 0.7 \, \text{mg/dL} \times 88.4 = 61.88 \, \mu\text{mol/L}. \] Now the equation becomes: \[ \text{GFR} = 144 \times \left(\frac{786.76}{61.88}\right)^{-1.209} \times 0.993^{38} \times 1.018. \] Let's calculate step by step. Step 1: Calculate the ratio \(\frac{786.76}{61.88}\). \[ \frac{786.76}{61.88} \approx 12.71. \] Step 2: Calculate \(\left(\frac{786.76}{61.88}\right)^{-1.209} = 12.71^{-1.209}.\) Using a calculator: \[ 12.71^{-1.209} \approx 0.057. \] Step 3: Calculate \(0.993^{38}.\) Using a calculator: \[ 0.993^{38} \approx 0.911. \] Step 4: Now plug these values into the equation: \[ \text{GFR} = 144 \times 0.057 \times 0.911 \times 1.018. \] Step 5: Multiply these values step by step. First, multiply \(144 \times 0.057\): \[ 144 \times 0.057 = 8.208. \] Next, multiply the result by 0.911: \[ 8.208 \times 0.911 \approx 7.478. \] Finally, multiply the result by 1.018: \[ 7.478 \times 1.018 \approx 7.61. \] So the estimated GFR is approximately 7.61 mL/min/1.73 m². </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the patient's GFR using the 2009 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, we first convert the serum creatinine from mg/dL to μmol/L.

However, the patient's serum creatinine level is given as 8.9 mg/dL. We need to convert this to micromoles per liter (μmol/L) because the CKD-EPI equation uses μmol/L for creatinine. The conversion factor from mg/dL to μmol/L for creatinine is approximately 88.4. So, \\[ \\text{Creatinine in μmol/L} = 8.9 \\, \\text{mg/dL} \\times 88.4 = 786.76 \\, \\mu\\text{mol/L}. \\] Now, let's use the 2009 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation for a female patient. The equation is: \\[ \\text{GFR} = 144 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{Creatinine}}{0.7}\\right)^{-1.209} \\times 0.993^{\\text{age}} \\times 1.018. \\] Given: - Creatinine = 786.76 μmol/L. - Age = 38 years. - The patient is female. Let's plug in the values. First, we need to convert the creatinine value to the form used in the equation. The reference value for creatinine in the equation is 0.7 mg/dL, which we need to convert to μmol/L: \\[ 0.7 \\, \\text{mg/dL} \\times 88.4 = 61.88 \\, \\mu\\text{mol/L}. \\] Now the equation becomes: \\[ \\text{GFR} = 144 \\times \\left(\\frac{786.76}{61.88}\\right)^{-1.209} \\times 0.993^{38} \\times 1.018. \\] Let's calculate step by step. Step 1: Calculate the ratio \\(\\frac{786.76}{61.88}\\). \\[ \\frac{786.76}{61.88} \\approx 12.71. \\] Step 2: Calculate \\(\\left(\\frac{786.76}{61.88}\\right)^{-1.209} = 12.71^{-1.209}.\\) Using a calculator: \\[ 12.71^{-1.209} \\approx 0.057. \\] Step 3: Calculate \\(0.993^{38}.\\) Using a calculator: \\[ 0.993^{38} \\approx 0.911. \\] Step 4: Now plug these values into the equation: \\[ \\text{GFR} = 144 \\times 0.057 \\times 0.911 \\times 1.018. \\] Step 5: Multiply these values step by step. First, multiply \\(144 \\times 0.057\\): \\[ 144 \\times 0.057 = 8.208. \\] Next, multiply the result by 0.911: \\[ 8.208 \\times 0.911 \\approx 7.478. \\] Finally, multiply the result by 1.018: \\[ 7.478 \\times 1.018 \\approx 7.61. \\] So the estimated GFR is approximately 7.61 mL/min/1.73 m². ", 'Ground Truth Answer': '5.366', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 38 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 8.9 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (8.9/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**38 * 1.012 = 5.366.\nHence, the GFR value is 5.366 ml/min/1.73 m².", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 77-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, stroke, and prostate cancer presented to the emergency department for accidental ingestion with nausea and vomiting. Approximately 90 minutes prior to arrival, the patient had gone to the refrigerator for water and had mistaken a bottle of 35% hydrogen peroxide for water, subsequently ingesting approximately 150 milliliters (mL). The patient immediately felt a burning sensation in his mouth and throat, followed by nausea and vomiting. He reportedly vomited several times, mostly dry heaving, but at one point had a small amount of blood in the vomitus. He otherwise denied any other complaints.
The patient was in no acute distress upon arrival. His blood pressure was elevated at 157/84 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, pulse 65 beats per minute, and arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Complete physical examination was negative for posterior oropharyngeal erythema, abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 × 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5–11.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0–16.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5–1.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73–393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().
Given the patient’s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.
Upon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.

The formula is: \[ \text{QTcB} = \frac{\text{QT interval}}{\sqrt{\text{RR interval}}} \] However, the RR interval is typically derived from the heart rate. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves in the ECG and is the reciprocal of the heart rate in beats per minute (bpm), converted to seconds. Step 2: Convert the given heart rate to the RR interval. The patient's heart rate is 46 bpm. The RR interval in seconds can be calculated as: \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{heart rate (in bpm)}} \] So, for a heart rate of 46 bpm: \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{46} \approx 1.3043 \, \text{seconds} \] Step 3: Use the Bazett formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTcB). The given QT interval is 330 msec. We plug in the values into the Bazett formula: \[ \text{QTcB} = \frac{\text{QT interval}}{\sqrt{\text{RR interval}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{1.3043}} \] Now, calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{1.3043} \approx 1.1421 \] Then, divide the QT interval by this value: \[ \text{QTcB} = \frac{330}{1.1421} \approx 289.00 \, \text{msec} \] So, the corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula is approximately 289 msec. </think> The final answer is approximately 289 msec.

Step-by-step thinking process to solve the question: Step 1: Recall the Bazett Formula for calculating the corrected QT interval (QTcB). The formula is: \[ \text{QTcB} = \frac{\text{QT interval}}{\sqrt{\text{RR interval}}} \] However, the RR interval is typically derived from the heart rate. The RR interval is the time between two consecutive R waves in the ECG and is the reciprocal of the heart rate in beats per minute (bpm), converted to seconds. Step 2: Convert the given heart rate to the RR interval. The patient's heart rate is 46 bpm. The RR interval in seconds can be calculated as: \[ \text{RR interval (in seconds)} = \frac{60}{\text{heart rate (in bpm)}} \] So, for a heart rate of 46 bpm: \[ \text{RR interval} = \frac{60}{46} \approx 1.3043 \, \text{seconds} \] Step 3: Use the Bazett formula to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTcB). The given QT interval is 330 msec. We plug in the values into the Bazett formula: \[ \text{QTcB} = \frac{\text{QT interval}}{\sqrt{\text{RR interval}}} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{1.3043}} \] Now, calculate the square root of the RR interval: \[ \sqrt{1.3043} \approx 1.1421 \] Then, divide the QT interval by this value: \[ \text{QTcB} = \frac{330}{1.1421} \approx 289.00 \, \text{msec} \] So, the corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula is approximately 289 msec.

 Here is the patient note:
A 14 year old Hispanic female with a 3 year history of type 2 diabetes on once-daily DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin presented for evaluation of morbid obesity with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, reflux, and irregular menses. She was overweight since preschool age. Family history was notable for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cholelithiasis.
At initial preoperative evaluation for bariatric surgery, weight was 129.3kg, height was 154.5cm, and BMI was 54.2kg/m2. Laboratory values were consistent with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 10.7%, FG 210mg/dL, and 2 hour glucose 378mg/dL, and metabolic syndrome with TG 138mg/dL, HDL 39mg/dL, WC 142cm and elevated BP 120/83 (96th percentile diastolic). Despite Sitagliptin100mg daily, Lantus 28 units daily and Metformin XR 1000mg, HbA1c remained between 9.9% and 10.3% for 6 months. She refused further increase in Metformin dose given gastrointestinal complaints. Sitagliptin was stopped and Exenatide 2mg QW was initiated as adjuvant treatment to Lantus 28 units and Metformin 1000mg daily at weight 131.1kg, BMI 54.4kg/m2, HbA1c 10.2%, and FG 163mg/dl. Within two months of treatment, HbA1c improved to 7.9%. After 6 months, she had sustained glycemic control with HbA1c 8.3% and notable improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including FG (−17mg/dl), insulin (−26uIU/ml), and TG (−12mg/dl). Patient’s weight was 131.5kg on day of gastric sleeve resection surgery with Exenatide QW discontinued following surgery due to normalization of blood glucose levels (HbA1c 5.8%) and weight 118.9kg noted at 2 months postoperatively.

 Here is the patient note:
A 26-year-old African American female with a medical history of SLE, ESRD due to LN, remote history of Steven–Johnson Syndrome due to sulfa allergy, and resistant hypertension presented to the emergency department with painful, peeling, blistering, rash and fever. She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.
Her physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6°F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.
Patient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4–10.8 × 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4–7.0 × 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1–15.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34–46%), platelet 69 (150–450 × 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6–20 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57–1.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7–10.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2–2.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0–40 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0–32 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15–50 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0–9 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90–180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10–40 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0–0.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.
Given her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven–Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3–858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.
Due to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.
It was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.

 Here is the patient note:
A 55-year-old man who suffered from hematochezia for 3 mo consulted our hospital in July 2016 (Figure ).
The pathological diagnosis following biopsy showed “moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon” (Figure ). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver.

The patient's height is 160 cm and weight is 56.8 kg. The formula for adjusted body weight is typically used in the context of calculating medication dosages and is often used for patients who are either overweight or underweight. The formula for adjusted body weight is: Adjusted Body Weight = Ideal Body Weight + 0.4 * (Actual Body Weight - Ideal Body Weight) To use this formula, we first need to calculate the ideal body weight. The ideal body weight for men can be calculated using the following formula: Ideal Body Weight (IBW) = 50 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch above 5 feet. However, since the height is given in centimeters, we should convert the height to inches first. 1 inch = 2.54 cm. So, the patient's height in inches is: \[ \text{Height in inches} = \frac{160 \, \text{cm}}{2.54 \, \text{cm/inch}} \approx 62.99 \, \text{inches}. \] Since the ideal body weight formula uses height in inches and starts from 5 feet (which is 60 inches), we need to calculate how many inches above 5 feet the patient is: \[ \text{Inches above 5 feet} = 62.99 \, \text{inches} - 60 \, \text{inches} = 2.99 \, \text{inches}. \] Now we can calculate the ideal body weight using the formula: \[ \text{Ideal Body Weight} = 50 \, \text{kg} + 2.3 \, \text{kg/inch} \times 2.99 \, \text{inches}. \] Let's calculate this step by step: \[ 2.3 \, \text{kg/inch} \times 2.99 \, \text{inches} \approx 6.877 \, \text{kg}. \] So, \[ \text{Ideal Body Weight} = 50 \, \text{kg} + 6.877 \, \text{kg} \approx 56.877 \, \text{kg}. \] Now we have the ideal body weight (approximately 56.877 kg) and the actual body weight (56.8 kg). We will use the adjusted body weight formula: \[ \text{Adjusted Body Weight} = \text{Ideal Body Weight} + 0.4 * (\text{Actual Body Weight} - \text{Ideal Body Weight}). \] Substitute the values we have: \[ \text{Adjusted Body Weight} = 56.877 \, \text{kg} + 0.4 * (56.8 \, \text{kg} - 56.877 \, \text{kg}). \] Calculate the difference between the actual body weight and the ideal body weight: \[ 56.8 \, \text{kg} - 56.877 \, \text{kg} = -0.077 \, \text{kg}. \] Now multiply this difference by 0.4: \[ 0.4 * (-0.077 \, \text{kg}) = -0.0308 \, \text{kg}. \] Now add this result to the ideal body weight: \[ \text{Adjusted Body Weight} = 56.877 \, \text{kg} + (-0.0308 \, \text{kg}) = 56.877 \, \text{kg} - 0.0308 \, \text{kg} \approx 56.8462 \, \text{kg}. \] Rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places, the adjusted body weight is approximately 56.85 kg. However, another common approach to calculating the adjusted body weight is to use a percentage of the actual body weight if the patient is overweight or underweight. A common rule is: If the patient's weight is within 20% of the ideal body weight, the actual body weight is used. Let's check if the patient's weight is within 20% of the ideal body weight. The ideal body weight is approximately 56.877 kg. Calculate 20% of the ideal body weight: \[ 0.20 \times 56.877 \, \text{kg} \approx 11.3754 \, \text{kg}. \] The range within 20% of the ideal body weight is: Lower limit = Ideal Body Weight - 20% of Ideal Body Weight = 56.877 kg - 11.3754 kg ≈ 45.5016 kg. Upper limit = Ideal Body Weight + 20% of Ideal Body Weight = 56.877 kg + 11.3754 kg ≈ 68.2524 kg. The patient's actual weight is 56.8 kg. Since 56.8 kg falls within the range of approximately 45.5016 kg to 68.2524 kg, the patient's weight is within 20% of the ideal body weight. Therefore, the adjusted body weight is the same as the actual body weight. Thus, the adjusted body weight is 56.8 kg.

Calculate 20% of the ideal body weight: \\[ 0.20 \\times 56.877 \\, \\text{kg} \\approx 11.3754 \\, \\text{kg}. \\] The range within 20% of the ideal body weight is: Lower limit = Ideal Body Weight - 20% of Ideal Body Weight = 56.877 kg - 11.3754 kg ≈ 45.5016 kg. Upper limit = Ideal Body Weight + 20% of Ideal Body Weight = 56.877 kg + 11.3754 kg ≈ 68.2524 kg. The patient's actual weight is 56.8 kg. Since 56.8 kg falls within the range of approximately 45.5016 kg to 68.2524 kg, the patient's weight is within 20% of the ideal body weight. Therefore, the adjusted body weight is the same as the actual body weight. Thus, the adjusted body weight is 56.8 kg. So the final answer is 56.8 kg. ", 'Ground Truth Answer': '56.849', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The patient's gender is Male.\nThe patient's height is 160.0 cm, which is 160.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 62.992 in. \nFor males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:\nIBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)\nPlugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (62.992 (in inches) - 60) = 56.882 kg.\nHence, the patient's IBW is 56.882 kg.The patient's weight is 56.8 kg. To compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 56.882 kg + 0.4 * (56.8 kg  - 56.882 kg) = 56.849 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 56.849 kg.", 'Result': 'Correct'}

The typical conception occurs around the time of ovulation, which is usually about 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period. Since the cycle length is 25 days, ovulation would typically occur approximately 25 - 14 = 11 days after the LMP. The patient's LMP was on 02/08/2024, and the cycle length is 25 days.

Step 4: Sum up the MME from all the medications. - MME from OxyCODONE = 90 MME - MME from HYDROmorphone = 560 MME - MME from Codeine = 3 MME The total daily MME is: \\( 90 + 560 + 3 = 653 \\, \\text{MME} \\). So, the patient's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 653. ", 'Ground Truth Answer': '793', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The curent Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 0 MME per day.\nThe patient's dose of OxyCODONE is 60 mg. The patient takes 1 doses/day of OxyCODONE. This means that the patient takes 60 mg/dose OxyCODONE * 1 dose/day = 60 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of OxyCODONE, multiply the 60 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 1.5 mme/mg, giving us 90.0 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of OxyCODONE to the total mme/day gives us 0 + 90.0 = 90.0 mme/day.\nThe patient's dose of HYDROmorphone is 70 mg. The patient takes 2 doses/day of HYDROmorphone. This means that the patient takes 70 mg/dose HYDROmorphone * 2 dose/day = 140 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of HYDROmorphone, multiply the 140 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 5 mme/mg, giving us 700 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of HYDROmorphone to the total mme/day gives us 90.0 + 700 = 790.0 mme/day.\nThe patient's dose of Codeine is 10 mg. The patient takes 2 doses/day of Codeine. This means that the patient takes 10 mg/dose Codeine * 2 dose/day = 20 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of Codeine, multiply the 20 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 0.15 mme/mg, giving us 3.0 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of Codeine to the total mme/day gives us 790.0 + 3.0 = 793.0 mme/day.\nThe patient's mme/day is 793.0 mme/day.", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 73-year-old African American woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and recently diagnosed immunoglobulin G MM, presented with 2 days’ history of fever, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. She was found to be obtunded in our Emergency department and was intubated for airway protection. She was febrile (39.33°C, 102.8°F), but hemodynamically stable. She demonstrated mild respiratory distress, had rales and wheezes on auscultation, and edema in both lower extremities. Initial laboratory results (Table ) revealed pancytopenia, elevated creatinine and corrected calcium of 7.3mg/dL, other electrolytes were within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Ten days prior to admission she received one dose of ZA, three doses of bortezomib, and seven doses of daily lenalidomide in addition to weekly dexamethasone. A clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever, acute renal failure and severe hypocalcemia was made. Treatment was started with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. She was also given calcium gluconate boluses for her hypocalcemia.
Even after 24 hours of treatment, her mental status did not improve. She remained febrile, her kidney functions worsened, and her calcium level became undetectable (<5mg/dL) and ionized calcium was 0.66mmol/L (see Table ). She was started on continuous intravenous calcium gluconate infusion in addition to boluses, which still did not increase her calcium levels. We then tested for vitamin D levels which were found to be low (13ng/mL). The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL). Intravenous paricalcitol was initiated, which did improve her calcium level, but, it did not revert to normal. Despite aggressive calcium replacement she remained persistently hypocalcemic and eventually developed tonic–clonic seizures. An electrocardiogram revealed a QT interval of 500ms using Bazett’s formula. Her neuroimaging, however, was normal except for several small calvarium lytic lesions (Figure ). Her family eventually made the decision to focus on comfort measures only, following which, she had a cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 17.

 Here is the patient note:
A 16-year-old Egyptian boy was referred to our department in 2008. He was comatose with serial fits, and had an acute onset of renal failure for which one session of dialysis was done. His relatives reported an acute onset of disturbed conscious level with serial fits and low grade fever four days earlier. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable.
At presentation, he was febrile (temperature 38.0°C) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/100 mmHg). Central venous pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg and urine output (UOP) was 100 cc. Otherwise, in general, his neurological examination was normal except for serial fits.
Initial laboratory tests included a white blood cell count of 13.7 (4.0-11.0 × 103/μL) with predominant lymphocytosis, hemoglobin 15.5 (13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelets 200 (150-400 × 103/μL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1003 (20-57 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1200 (21-72 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.1 (0.0-1.5 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 0.6 (0.0-0.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 120 (30-136 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 and prothrombin time 11 (10.0-13.5 s), serum albumin 4 (3.5-6 mg/dL), random blood sugar 250 (140-199 mg/dL), creatinine 10 (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), urea 330 (15-45 mg/dL), Na+ 136 (135-145 mmol/L), K+ 3.6 (3.5-5), and calcium 9 (9-11 mg/dL). For acute hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HB core antibody, and HCV-antibodies by third generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as HIV-antibodies, serologies were negative. Also, an autoimmune screen, anti-double stranded DNA, pANCA and cANCA, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were all negative. A surface echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 75-80.
Serum, liver and renal biochemistry was normal 4 days earlier (AST 32 IU/L, ALT 40 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL) when the patient was admitted to the fever hospital. He was receiving ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every 24 hours, phenytoin 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and paracetamol 0.5 g every 6 hours.
An abdominopelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, and chest X-ray was normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast revealed mild brain edema (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ), and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.
Serology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.
Because of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.
Over the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ). The patient left hospital and made a complete recovery with no residual effects (Table ).

He was comatose with serial fits, and had an acute onset of renal failure for which one session of dialysis was done. His relatives reported an acute onset of disturbed conscious level with serial fits and low grade fever four days earlier. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable. At presentation, he was febrile (temperature 38.0°C) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/100 mmHg). Central venous pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg and urine output (UOP) was 100 cc. Otherwise, in general, his neurological examination was normal except for serial fits. Initial laboratory tests included a white blood cell count of 13.7 (4.0-11.0 × 103/μL) with predominant lymphocytosis, hemoglobin 15.5 (13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelets 200 (150-400 × 103/μL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1003 (20-57 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1200 (21-72 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.1 (0.0-1.5 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 0.6 (0.0-0.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 120 (30-136 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 and prothrombin time 11 (10.0-13.5 s), serum albumin 4 (3.5-6 mg/dL), random blood sugar 250 (140-199 mg/dL), creatinine 10 (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), urea 330 (15-45 mg/dL), Na+ 136 (135-145 mmol/L), K+ 3.6 (3.5-5), and calcium 9 (9-11 mg/dL). For acute hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HB core antibody, and HCV-antibodies by third generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as HIV-antibodies, serologies were negative. Also, an autoimmune screen, anti-double stranded DNA, pANCA and cANCA, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were all negative. A surface echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 75-80. Serum, liver and renal biochemistry was normal 4 days earlier (AST 32 IU/L, ALT 40 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL) when the patient was admitted to the fever hospital. He was receiving ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every 24 hours, phenytoin 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and paracetamol 0.5 g every 6 hours. An abdominopelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, and chest X-ray was normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast revealed mild brain edema (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ), and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes. Serology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF. Because of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics. Over the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ). The patient left hospital and made a complete recovery with no residual effects (Table ). Here is the task: What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 136.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 136.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 136.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 250.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (250.0 - 100) = 139.6 mEq/L.\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 139.6 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Correct'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 53-year-old white female with the past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, coronary artery disease after RCA stent, and peripheral vascular disease after bilateral stents to the common iliac arteries was transferred to our hospital after being diagnosed to have osteomyelitis of right great toe and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from an outside hospital. She was started on ertapenem for bacteremia before getting transferred to our hospital. The baseline laboratory values done on an outpatient evaluation basis just 10 days prior to the admission were WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 39, platelets 564, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5, glucose 222, sodium 138 meq/L, potassium 4.2 meq/L, chloride 101 meq/L, bicarbonate 25 meq/L, bilirubin total-0.3 mg/dL, bilirubin direct 0.1 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT)-8 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 9 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 78 IU/L, direct albumin, 3.8 gm/dL, protein total 7.80 gm/dL, PT-10.2 s, INR 1.0, PTT 28 s, and sedimentation rate 72 h; blood culture showed no growth even after 5 days. On admission, physical examination findings were unremarkable except for her right great toe which was swollen and oozing; pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory showed an increase in leukocytes 16,300/uL; reference range (4500–8500), platelets 775 thousand/cu·mm reference (140–440), glucose 300 mg/dL (70–105), creatinine 2 mg/dL (0.6–1.1), low glomerular filtration rate (gfr) 26 mL/min, normal PT 16.4 s (9.0–12.0), PTT 42 s (25–35), and INR 1.6. Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis. On day 15, she was found to be jaundiced with mild disorientation; her liver function showed elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) levels (bilirubin total (T)-9.6; direct (D)-7.3; ALP-388 IU/L; AST-67 IU/L; ALT-24 IU/L; GGTP-878 IU/L, with decreased creatinine clearance 30 mL/min/24 hr reference range (72–141 mL/min/24 hr). Pharmacy was consulted for drug-related hepatic injury, and nafcillin was discontinued immediately. A mild, transient drop in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGTP was noted immediately after stopping nafcillin. Further workup for hepatitis and jaundice was done to rule out other causes of hepatotoxicity. Workup included a negative direct coombs, and antibody screening, negative ANCA test for MPO and PR3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antismooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and HLA B27 were also negative. Levels of C3 and C4 complements were normal; liver-kidney microsomal antibody, alpha fetoprotein, and antithyroid peroxidase were also normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogenous appearance of liver parenchyma, and MRI abdomen was normal. The patient had an elevated GGTP, ALP, and bilirubin, mostly direct bilirubin () before being discharged to transitional care unit for rehabilitation.
On day 36, her jaundice worsened, and she was admitted at a liver transplant center for further evaluation. Her workup included elevated AST 152 IU/L, ALT 85 IU/L, ALP >1800 IU/L, GGT >1500 IU/L, and total bilirubin 11.5 mg/dL, repeat ultrasound abdomen showed no intra- and extrahepatic biliary obstruction; MRCP was unremarkable; liver biopsy showed diffuse hepatocanalicular cholestasis with focal centrizonal bile infarct, periportal hepatocellular swelling and mild nodular hyperplasia like changes. Diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice secondary to nafcillin was made and Ursodiol 10 mg/kg was started. There was no evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy. The patient was discharged to home. The patient was followed as an outpatient with regular blood tests for LFT. The GGTP and ALP both remained elevated >1500 IU/L.
On day 54, she was readmitted to the ER for abdominal pain and hematuria. Her workup revealed bilirubin (T-28.7 mg/dL, D-21.3 mg/dL), ALP >1884 IU/L, ALT 24 IU/L, ammonia 45 ug/dL (reference 31–123), creatinine 1.6, INR 5.4, PT 58.5, haemoglobin 7.5 gm/dL (reference 11.5–16.0), and haematocrit 21% (reference 37–47); urinalysis showed blood in urine, and blood culture remained negative. She was transfused two units of blood and was hemodynamically stabilized. She was monitored closely in the hospital. On day 84, she redeveloped an abdominal pain and was shifted to the liver transplant centre for further evaluation, where she went into respiratory arrest and succumbed to her underlying disease conditions.

Let's use the values from the time when the patient first showed signs of jaundice (day 15) and the final values when the patient was readmitted on day 54. Initial values (day 15): - Total bilirubin (T1): 9.6 mg/dL - Direct bilirubin (D1): 7.3 mg/dL Final values (day 54): - Total bilirubin (T2): 28.7 mg/dL - Direct bilirubin (D2): 21.3 mg/dL Step 2: Calculate the change in total bilirubin and the change in direct bilirubin.

The delta ratio is defined as the change in direct bilirubin divided by the change in total bilirubin. Delta ratio = (Change in direct bilirubin) / (Change in total bilirubin) = 14.0 mg/dL / 19.1 mg/dL ≈ 0.733 Rounded to two decimal places, the delta ratio is approximately 0.73.

To calculate the delta ratio, we need the change in direct bilirubin and the change in total bilirubin between two key time points. We chose the values from day 15 when the patient first showed signs of jaundice and day 54 when the patient was readmitted to the ER. The values on day 15 were: Total bilirubin (T1) = 9.6 mg/dL and Direct bilirubin (D1) = 7.3 mg/dL. The values on day 54 were: Total bilirubin (T2) = 28.7 mg/dL and Direct bilirubin (D2) = 21.3 mg/dL. The change in total bilirubin is T2 - T1 = 28.7 - 9.6 = 19.1 mg/dL. The change in direct bilirubin is D2 - D1 = 21.3 - 7.3 = 14.0 mg/dL. The delta ratio is the change in direct bilirubin divided by the change in total bilirubin, which is 14.0 / 19.1 ≈ 0.733, or approximately 0.73 when rounded to two decimal places.
 To calculate the delta ratio, we need to find the ratio of the change in the direct bilirubin to the change in the total bilirubin over the course of the patient's treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the initial and final values of total bilirubin and direct bilirubin.

Let's use the values from the time when the patient first showed signs of jaundice (day 15) and the final values when the patient was readmitted on day 54. Initial values (day 15): - Total bilirubin (T1): 9.6 mg/dL - Direct bilirubin (D1): 7.3 mg/dL Final values (day 54): - Total bilirubin (T2): 28.7 mg/dL - Direct bilirubin (D2): 21.3 mg/dL Step 2: Calculate the change in total bilirubin and the change in direct bilirubin. Change in total bilirubin = T2 - T1 = 28.7 mg/dL - 9.6 mg/dL = 19.1 mg/dL Change in direct bilirubin = D2 - D1 = 21.3 mg/dL - 7.3 mg/dL = 14.0 mg/dL Step 3: Calculate the delta ratio. The delta ratio is defined as the change in direct bilirubin divided by the change in total bilirubin. Delta ratio = (Change in direct bilirubin) / (Change in total bilirubin) = 14.0 mg/dL / 19.1 mg/dL ≈ 0.733 Rounded to two decimal places, the delta ratio is approximately 0.73. So the delta ratio is approximately 0.73.

Blood culture done two times showed no growth even after 5 days. X-ray right foot showed osteomyelitis of right great toe; ertapenem was discontinued and was started on nafcillin 12 gram/day. The day nafcillin started was considered as day 1. Surgery was done under general anesthesia on day 4 for the amputation of right great toe. Abdominal aortogram was performed on day 10 and was found to have mild narrowing at the level of tibioperoneal trunk with areas of stenosis the dorsalis pedis artery was occluded. The patient underwent right second toe amputation and percutaneous angioplasty for worsening of her osteomyelitis.

 Here is the patient note:
A 45-year-old woman with a substantial past medical history of squamous cell cancer (SCC) was treated with laryngectomy and offered tracheostomy. She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.
On admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.
Based on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.
In addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.
Differential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.
After four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?

Given that the serum albumin is 4.2 g/dL, we can plug in the values into the formula. Corrected AG = 22 + 2.5 * (4 - 4.2) = 22 + 2.5 * (-0.2) = 22 + 2.5 * (-0.2) = 22 - 0.5 = 21.5 mEq/L. However, the question asks for the "albumin-corrected delta gap," not the corrected anion gap. The delta gap is defined as the difference between the measured anion gap and the normal anion gap. The normal anion gap is typically between 8-12 mEq/L. Let's use the average normal anion gap of 10 mEq/L for simplicity. The measured anion gap is given as 22 mEq/L. Now, we need to calculate the albumin-corrected anion gap first, which we already calculated as 21.5 mEq/L. The albumin-corrected delta gap is the difference between the albumin-corrected anion gap and the normal anion gap. Albumin-corrected delta gap = Corrected AG - Normal AG = 21.5 - 10 = 11.5 mEq/L. So the albumin-corrected delta gap is 11.5 mEq/L.

She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.\nOn admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nOn laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.\nBased on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.\nIn addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.\nDifferential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.\nAfter four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.", 'Question': "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?", 'LLM Answer': '11.5', 'LLM Explanation': 'No Explanation', 'LLM Thinking': 'Step-by-step thinking process to solve the question: Step 1: Identify the necessary information from the patient note to calculate the albumin-corrected delta gap. The patient note provides the following information: - Anion gap (AG) = 22 - Serum albumin on admission = 4.2 g/dL The formula for the anion gap is: AG = Na - (Cl + HCO3). From the laboratory assessment, we have: - Sodium (Na) = 148 mmol/L - Chloride (Cl) = 110 mmol/L - Bicarbonate (HCO3) = 6 mmol/L Using these values, we can calculate the anion gap: AG = 148 - (110 + 6) = 148 - 116 = 32 mmol/L. It seems there\'s a discrepancy because the patient note states that the anion gap (AG) is 22. Let\'s use the given AG of 22 for our calculations. The formula to calculate the albumin-corrected anion gap is: Corrected AG = Measured AG + 2.5 * (4 - Serum Albumin). Given that the serum albumin is 4.2 g/dL, we can plug in the values into the formula. Corrected AG = 22 + 2.5 * (4 - 4.2) = 22 + 2.5 * (-0.2) = 22 + 2.5 * (-0.2) = 22 - 0.5 = 21.5 mEq/L.

The albumin-corrected delta gap is the difference between the albumin-corrected anion gap and the normal anion gap. Albumin-corrected delta gap = Corrected AG - Normal AG = 21.5 - 10 = 11.5 mEq/L. So the albumin-corrected delta gap is 11.5 mEq/L. ', 'Ground Truth Answer': '28.95', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 40.95 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 40.95 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 40.95 - 12 = 28.95 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 28.95 mEq/L.", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}

The patient has tanned skin and bluish-black gums, which could suggest a condition like Addison's disease (adrenal insufficiency), given the symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and the changes in skin pigmentation. Step 2: Recall the formula for calculating the corrected sodium concentration when there is suspected hyponatremia due to hyperkalemia or other factors. However, the most common correction is for hyperglycemia-induced pseudohyponatremia. The formula to correct sodium for hyperglycemia is: Corrected Sodium = Measured Sodium + (Glucose - 100) / 18 But let's check the glucose level first. The glucose level is 70 mg/dL, which is within the normal range (typically 70-99 mg/dL for fasting glucose). Since the glucose level is not elevated, we don't need to correct the sodium for hyperglycemia. Step 3: Consider other factors that might require sodium correction. The patient has a high potassium level (K+ = 5.4 mEq/L), which is within the upper limit of the normal range (typically 3.5-5.0 mEq/L), but it's not extremely high. Hyperkalemia can sometimes be associated with pseudohyponatremia, but the correction for hyperkalemia is not as straightforward as the one for hyperglycemia. Step 4: Consider the possibility of pseudohyponatremia due to hypertriglyceridemia or hyperproteinemia. However, we don't have information about the patient's triglyceride or protein levels, so we can't use this correction. Step 5: Given the symptoms and the physical findings (tanned skin and bluish-black gums), we should consider the possibility of Addison's disease. In Addison's disease, the patient may have hyperkalemia and hyponatremia due to adrenal insufficiency. However, the sodium level given is 134 mEq/L, which is within the normal range (typically 135-145 mEq/L). The potassium level is slightly elevated (5.4 mEq/L), which could be consistent with Addison's disease. Since the glucose level is normal (70 mg/dL), and there's no information suggesting hypertriglyceridemia or hyperproteinemia, we don't have a clear indication to correct the sodium level. Therefore, the measured sodium concentration is 134 mEq/L, and since there's no need for correction based on the available information, the corrected sodium concentration is the same as the measured sodium concentration. So the corrected sodium concentration is 134 mEq/L.</think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "Step-by-step thinking process to solve the question:\nStep 1: Identify the given information from the patient note.

 Here is the patient note:
A 60-year-old heterosexual man presented with 75 lb weight loss, dysphagia, jaw pain/swelling, hypotension and acute kidney injury. Medical history was significant for emphysema, hypertension, stroke, alcohol withdrawal seizure, alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking. He worked as a landscaper.
On presentation vitals were: 37.5°C, 68/48 mmHg, 95 beats/min, respiratory rate 22/min, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed halitosis, poor dentition, diffuse lower gum swelling and erythema. Soft palate showed exophytic growth (Figure ).
Abdominal exam was unremarkable. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 43 mg/dl, glucose 94 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, creatinine 2.3 (baseline 1.1 mg/dl), albumin 1.5 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 574 U/L, lactic acid 2.9 mmol/L, Hb 10.8 g/dl with normal MCV, RDW, decreased RBC 3.87 x 106/ul (normal > 4.2), normal WBC 5000/ul, platelets 167,000/ul, normal bilirubin and ALT. CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.
Piperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis. Further testing revealed HIV RNA viral load (negative), HTLV-1/HTLV-2 DNA PCR (negative), hepatitis panel testing for hepatitis A, B and C (negative), vitamin B12 (normal), folate 3.7 ng/ml (low), reticulocyte count 2.2%, lactate dehydrogenase (normal), haptoglobin (normal), iron studies showed elevated ferritin, low iron, elevated transferrin saturation (anemia of chronic inflammation), copper (normal), zinc levels 37 mcg/dl (low), SPEP/UPEP (no monoclonal protein; diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia seen), IgA 467 mg/dl (high), IgG 2160 mg/dl (high), IgM 252 mg/dl (high), free light chain ratio (normal). Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) 1:160, anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) IgG 3.3 U/dl (high). Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) (negative), cytomegalovirus PCR (negative) and Epstein-Barr virus PCR were negative. Ultrasound abdomen showed no organomegaly. Bone marrow biopsy showed granulomas consistent with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
The patient subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so an EGD was performed which showed multiple 3-5 mm nodules in the second part of the duodenum (Figure ) which were biopsied.
Pathology showed duodenitis with fungal organisms on Gomorri-Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain compatible with histoplasmosis (Figure ).
CMV immunostain and AFB stain were negative. Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis, a 1 cm clean-based ulcer in the sigmoid colon (Figure ) which on biopsy showed the presence of histoplasma (Figure ).
The patient was then switched to oral itraconazole and discharged home on the same along with azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folic acid.
Four months later, the patient had gained 10 lbs of weight, his dysphagia had resolved, and he was continuing his itraconazole therapy. His CD4 count now was 55/ul. Repeat low CD4+ T-cell count satisfied the criteria for the diagnosis of ICL.

Here is the task:
What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?

First, we calculate the anion gap using the formula: Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate). Plugging in the values, we get: Anion Gap = 139 - (102 + 30) = 139 - 132 = 7 mEq/L. Next, we use the formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap: Albumin-corrected Anion Gap = Anion Gap + 2.5 × (Normal Albumin - Patient's Albumin). The normal albumin level is typically around 4 g/dL, and the patient's albumin level is 1.5 g/dL. So, we calculate the difference between the normal albumin and the patient's albumin: 4 - 1.5 = 2.5. Now, multiply this difference by 2.5: 2.5 × 2.5 = 6.25. Add this result to the anion gap: Albumin-corrected Anion Gap = 7 + 6.25 = 13.25 mEq/L. Therefore, the albumin-corrected anion gap is 13.25 mEq/L.
 To calculate the albumin-corrected anion gap, we need the following values from the patient's serum chemistries: - Sodium (Na): 139 mEq/L - Chloride (Cl): 102 mEq/L - Bicarbonate (HCO3): 30 mEq/L - Albumin: 1.5 g/dL The formula for the anion gap (AG) is: \[ \text{Anion Gap} = \text{Sodium} - (\text{Chloride} + \text{Bicarbonate}) \] Using the given values: \[ \text{Anion Gap} = 139 - (102 + 30) = 139 - 132 = 7 \, \text{mEq/L} \] The formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap is: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected Anion Gap} = \text{Anion Gap} + 2.5 \times (\text{Normal Albumin} - \text{Patient's Albumin}) \] The normal albumin level is typically around 4 g/dL.

Now, we plug in the values into the formula: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected Anion Gap} = 7 + 2.5 \times (4 - 1.5) \] Calculate the difference between the normal albumin and the patient's albumin: \[ 4 - 1.5 = 2.5 \] Now multiply this difference by 2.5: \[ 2.5 \times 2.5 = 6.25 \] Add this result to the anion gap: \[ \text{Albumin-corrected Anion Gap} = 7 + 6.25 = 13.25 \, \text{mEq/L} \] So, the albumin-corrected anion gap is 13.25 mEq/L.

CT neck (Figure ) showed soft palate asymmetry with thickening.\nPiperacillin-tazobactam was started in addition to chlorhexidine empirically to provide coverage for any deep-seated bacterial infection of the oral mucosa while providing anaerobic coverage. ENT did soft palate biopsy which on GMS stain showed numerous round to oval yeast forms present intracellularly within the histiocytes and in the extracellular subepithelial tissue consistent with histoplasmosis (Figure ).\nHIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody screen was negative. Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to amphotericin B. CD4 count was 36 cells/ul, CD8 count was normal, CD4:CD8 0.1 (normal: 1-3.6). Given a low CD4 count, he was started on azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for prophylaxis.

Next, we use the formula for the albumin-corrected anion gap: Albumin-corrected Anion Gap = Anion Gap + 2.5 × (Normal Albumin - Patient's Albumin). The normal albumin level is typically around 4 g/dL, and the patient's albumin level is 1.5 g/dL. So, we calculate the difference between the normal albumin and the patient's albumin: 4 - 1.5 = 2.5.

To calculate the patient's Cardiac Risk Index using the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for pre-operative risk rule, we need to evaluate the following factors: Age > 75 years, Ischemic heart disease (IHD) or history of myocardial infarction (MI), Congestive heart failure (CHF), Cerebrovascular disease (CVD), Renal insufficiency (creatinine > 2 mg/dL or > 177 µmol/L), Diabetes mellitus, and Surgery type (high-risk surgery). Let's evaluate each factor for the given patient: 1. Age > 75 years: The patient is 81 years old. This criterion is met (Yes). 2. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) or history of myocardial infarction (MI): The patient denies any history of chest pain or dyspnea and there's no mention of IHD or MI. This criterion is not met (No). 3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has no history of congestive heart failure. This criterion is not met (No). 4. Cerebrovascular disease (CVD): The patient has a history of a past cerebrovascular accident with residual left-sided weakness. This criterion is met (Yes). 5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is 120 µmol/L. Converting this to mg/dL gives approximately 1.36 mg/dL, which is less than 2 mg/dL. Therefore, this criterion is not met (No). 6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has chronic type 2 diabetes managed with insulin. This criterion is met (Yes). 7. Surgery type: The patient is scheduled for a high-risk abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery. This criterion is met (Yes). Now let's count the number of risk factors that are met: - Age > 75 years: Yes (1 point) - Cerebrovascular disease: Yes (1 point) - Diabetes mellitus: Yes (1 point) - High-risk surgery: Yes (1 point) Total points = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 points. According to the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, the risk categories are: - 0 points: < 1% risk - 1 point: 1-2% risk - 2 points: 2-4% risk - 3 points: 4-6% risk - 4 points: 6-9% risk - 5 points: > 9% risk Since the patient has 4 points, the cardiac risk index indicates a 6-9% risk of cardiac complications.
Let's approach this step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-operative Risk Rule factors. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index includes the following factors: - Age > 75 years - Ischemic heart disease (IHD) or history of myocardial infarction (MI) - Congestive heart failure (CHF) - Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) - Renal insufficiency (creatinine > 2 mg/dL or > 177 µmol/L) - Diabetes mellitus - Surgery type (high-risk surgery) Step 2: Let's evaluate each factor for the given patient: 1. Age > 75 years: The patient is 81 years old. This criterion is met (Yes). 2. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) or history of myocardial infarction (MI): The patient denies any history of chest pain or dyspnea and there's no mention of IHD or MI. This criterion is not met (No). 3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has no history of congestive heart failure. This criterion is not met (No). 4. Cerebrovascular disease (CVD): The patient has a history of a past cerebrovascular accident with residual left-sided weakness. This criterion is met (Yes). 5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is 120 µmol/L. We need to convert this to mg/dL to check if it exceeds 2 mg/dL. The conversion factor is 1 mg/dL = 88.4 µmol/L. Therefore, 120 µmol/L is approximately 120 / 88.4 ≈ 1.36 mg/dL. Since 1.36 mg/dL is less than 2 mg/dL, this criterion is not met (No). 6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has chronic type 2 diabetes managed with insulin. This criterion is met (Yes). 7. Surgery type: The patient is scheduled for a high-risk abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery. This criterion is met (Yes). Now let's count the number of risk factors that are met: - Age > 75 years: Yes (1 point) - Ischemic heart disease or history of MI: No (0 points) - Congestive heart failure: No (0 points) - Cerebrovascular disease: Yes (1 point) - Renal insufficiency: No (0 points) - Diabetes mellitus: Yes (1 point) - High-risk surgery: Yes (1 point) Adding up the points: - Age > 75 years: 1 point - Cerebrovascular disease: 1 point - Diabetes mellitus: 1 point - High-risk surgery: 1 point Total points = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 points. According to the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, the risk categories are as follows: - 0 points: < 1% risk of cardiac complications - 1 point: 1-2% risk - 2 points: 2-4% risk - 3 points: 4-6% risk - 4 points: 6-9% risk - 5 points: > 9% risk Since the patient has 4 points, the cardiac risk index indicates a 6-9% risk of cardiac complications. Therefore, the patient's Cardiac Risk Index is 4 points, corresponding to a 6-9% risk of cardiac complications.

This means that we increment the score by one and the current total will be 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe concentration of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 120.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 120.0 µmol. To convert 120.0 µmol of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 120.0 µmol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.00012 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine. To convert from mol Pre-Operative Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.00012 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.014 g Pre-Operative Creatinine. To convert 0.014 g of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.014 g Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 14.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 14.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.4 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL.

The PSI is based on several factors including age, vital signs, comorbidities, and laboratory results. Let's break this down step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the patient's age. The patient is 75 years old. Step 2: Identify the vital signs and other clinical findings from the given information: - Body temperature: 36.5°C (which is within the normal range) - Pulse rate: 82 bpm (normal range is typically between 60-100 bpm, so this is within the normal range) - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (normal range is typically between 12-20 breaths per minute, so this is slightly elevated) - Blood pressure: 128/80 mm Hg (within the normal range) Step 3: Identify the laboratory results: - Hematocrit: 39% (normal range for females is typically between 37-47%, so this is within the normal range) - Glucose: 180 mg/dL (elevated, indicating hyperglycemia) - Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 27 mg/dL (slightly high, but within the normal range which is typically 7-20 mg/dL for adults) - Sodium: 139 mEq/L (within the normal range, typically 135-145 mEq/L) - Arterial Blood Gas (ABG): pH 7.40 (normal), PaO2 80 mm Hg (this indicates some degree of hypoxemia since the normal PaO2 is typically above 80 mm Hg) Step 4: Identify the chest X-ray findings: - Chest X-ray shows indications of pleural effusion. Step 5: Identify comorbidities: The patient has a past history of congestive heart failure (CHF). There is no mention of liver disease or neoplastic conditions. Now, let's use the PSI scoring system. The PSI is calculated based on the following categories: age, vital signs, comorbidities, and laboratory values. The PSI score involves assigning points to different risk factors and then categorizing the patient into one of five classes (I-V), with Class V being the highest risk. Let's evaluate each component: 1. **Age:** - The patient is 75 years old. According to the PSI scoring system, age is a significant factor. 2. **Vital Signs and Clinical Findings:** - Temperature: 36.5°C (normal) - Pulse rate: 82 bpm (normal) - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (slightly elevated but not necessarily abnormal for PSI) - Blood pressure: 128/80 mm Hg (normal) 3. **Laboratory Results:** - Hematocrit: 39% (normal) - Glucose: 180 mg/dL (elevated, indicating hyperglycemia) - BUN: 27 mg/dL (slightly elevated) - Sodium: 139 mEq/L (normal) - pH: 7.40 (normal) - PaO2: 80 mm Hg (indicative of some hypoxemia) 4. **Comorbidities:** - Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) 5. **Chest X-ray:** - Pleural effusion Now, let's use the PSI scoring system to calculate the score. The PSI score includes the following risk factors: - Age - Comorbidities (e.g., CHF, liver disease, etc.) - Vital signs (e.g., heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure) - Laboratory values (e.g., BUN, creatinine, hematocrit, sodium, glucose, etc.) Let's assign points based on the PSI criteria: 1. **Age:** - 75 years old: This puts the patient in the age group of 70-79 years. 2. **Comorbidities:** - The patient has congestive heart failure (CHF), which is a significant comorbidity. 3. **Vital Signs:** - Pulse rate: 82 bpm (normal) - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (slightly elevated but not necessarily abnormal for PSI) - Blood pressure: 128/80 mm Hg (normal) 4. **Laboratory Values:** - Hematocrit: 39% (normal) - BUN: 27 mg/dL (slightly elevated) - Sodium: 139 mEq/L (normal) - Glucose: 180 mg/dL (elevated) - pH: 7.40 (normal) - PaO2: 80 mm Hg (indicative of some hypoxemia) Now, let's use the PSI scoring system to categorize the patient. The PSI score involves adding up points for various risk factors and then determining the class. Here are the key risk factors and their corresponding points: - Age 70-79 years: 1 point - Comorbidities: - Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): 1 point - Vital Signs: - Respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute: not applicable (22 breaths per minute) - Systolic BP < 90 mm Hg: not applicable (128 mm Hg) - Heart rate > 125 bpm: not applicable (82 bpm) - Laboratory Values: - BUN > 30 mg/dL: not applicable (27 mg/dL) - Hematocrit < 30%: not applicable (39%) - Sodium < 130 mEq/L: not applicable (139 mEq/L) - Glucose > 250 mg/dL: not applicable (180 mg/dL) - pH < 7.35: not applicable (7.40) - PaO2 < 60 mm Hg: not applicable (80 mm Hg) However, since the PSI score involves a more detailed point system and categorization, let's use the simplified approach to categorize the patient into one of the PSI classes. Given the information: - The patient is 75 years old. - She has congestive heart failure. - She has a slightly elevated respiratory rate (22 breaths per minute). - She has elevated glucose (180 mg/dL). - She has a slightly elevated BUN (27 mg/dL). - She has a PaO2 of 80 mm Hg, indicating some hypoxemia. - Chest X-ray shows pleural effusion. Based on these factors, we can use the PSI calculator or the PSI scoring system to determine the class. Let's break it down step-by-step using the PSI criteria: 1. **Age:** - 75 years old: 1 point 2. **Comorbidities:** - Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): 1 point 3. **Vital Signs:** - Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (not a risk factor for PSI unless > 30) - Blood pressure: 128/80 mm Hg (normal) - Heart rate: 82 bpm (normal) 4. **Laboratory Values:** - BUN: 27 mg/dL (slightly elevated but not > 30 mg/dL, so no additional points) - Hematocrit: 39% (normal) - Sodium: 139 mEq/L (normal) - Glucose: 180 mg/dL (elevated but not > 250 mg/dL, so no additional points) - pH: 7.40 (normal) - PaO2: 80 mm Hg (normal for PSI unless < 60 mm Hg, so no additional points) Now, let's sum up the points: - Age: 1 point - Comorbidities: 1 point (CHF) Total points from the given information: 2 points. However, the PSI also considers other factors such as the presence of pleural effusion on chest X-ray and the overall clinical picture. Given that the patient has CHF and pleural effusion, and considering the slightly elevated respiratory rate and BUN, it suggests a moderate severity. Based on the PSI scoring system, the patient likely falls into a higher risk category due to the presence of CHF and the chest X-ray findings. After evaluating the patient's characteristics, the most likely PSI class is Class III or IV. To simplify, let's use the PSI calculator approach. For a 75-year-old patient with CHF and pleural effusion on chest X-ray, along with slightly elevated BUN and glucose levels, the PSI score would likely place the patient in a higher risk category. Thus, the patient's PSI score is likely to be in Class III or IV. However, without the exact PSI calculator, we can estimate that the patient is at a moderate to high risk. Given the information and the presence of CHF and pleural effusion, the patient likely falls into Class III or IV. Let's assume the final PSI class is Class III. So the answer is that the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) is likely Class III. {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), we need to use the criteria and scoring system for PSI.

The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 139.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 95.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 180.0 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's hemocratit is 39.0 %. The patient's hemocratit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 80.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 95.0.\nThe patient's PSI score is 95.0.", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}

 Here is the patient note:
A 69-year-old male has come in for a routine evaluation, complaining of dark, tarry stools over the last two days. Claiming no history of heart failure, the patient presented with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and a systolic blood pressure reading of 130 mm Hg. Laboratory tests were ordered and returned a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 18 mg/dL and hemoglobin concentration at 13 g/dL. Review of his medication profile revealed he has been consistently taking sodium bicarbonate for his diagnosed peptic stomach ulcer. Despite the normalcy of most of his parameters, his complaint of melena urges further medical attention.

 Here is the patient note:
A 47-year-old African American man came to the emergency department with complaints of 4 days of severe, colicky back pain with some radiation to the flanks, associated with nausea and vomiting and a noticeable decrease in urination. He denied any history of trauma, stones, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, rash, constipation, diarrhea, fever, or previous similar pain. He denied any unusual food or sick contact. He denied taking any medications for the past 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and antacids. He denied smoking, alcohol, and drugs although it had been noted in the chart that he had a positive urinary toxicology screen in the past for cocaine. Although he had a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia diagnosed 3 years previously during a brief hospital stay, he was not taking any of the recommended prescription medications. Family history was positive for premature atherosclerosis, yet negative for autoimmune diseases and tuberculosis. On physical examination, his vital signs included blood pressure of 235/125 mm Hg, pulse 90 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37°C, O2 saturation 96% on room air. He was awake and alert, had clear lungs, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, a soft abdomen with normal bowels sounds, bilateral costophrenic tenderness to percussion, a normal prostate, and neurologic examination.
Creatinine was 10.48 mg/dL, up from his previous level of 1.15 mg/dL at his previous visit 3 years prior. Blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/L, K 4.4 mEq/L, Cl 100 mEq/L, CO2 22 mEq/L, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Mg 2.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 15 g/dL, hematocrit 45%, white blood cells (WBC) of 9100 with neutrophils 75%, lymphocytes 12.5%, and eosinophils 0.9%, platelets of 167 000. His troponin was 0.02 ng/mL, CK-MB 2.6 ng/mL, BNP 53 pg/mL, amylase 70 U/L, lipase 69 U/L, international normalized ratio 1.1, prothrombin time 13 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 31 seconds, HbA1c 6.6%, aspartate transaminotransferase (AST) 25 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 IU/L, albumin 3.8 g/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, C-reactive protein 25 mg/L. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood, no red blood cells, no WBCs, including no eosinophils by special stain, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrates, negative leukocyte esterase and negative for bacteria, trace ketone, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.015.

His hepatitis panel: C-ANCA (cytoplasmic–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) Ag, P-ANCA (perinuclear–antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), anti–glomerular basement membrane Ag, anti-myeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody and Helicobacter pylori IgA were all negative. Creatine phosphokinase was 127 mg/dL and his serum electrophoresis was normal. C3 was 119 mg/dL and C4 was 88.5 mg/dL (both normal). Anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) antibodies were positive.
His chest and abdominal radiographs were normal, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed no urinary obstruction. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal wall motion and ejection fraction. Electrocardiography showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which were unchanged since 2010.
The patient’s blood pressure was initially controlled with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine. Over the first 3 days of admission, his urinary output decreased from 700 cm3/d to less than 400 cm3/d and his creatinine rose to 13.6 mg/dL. Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions. The methylprednisolone was tapered to 80 mg every 6 hours after 3 days and then changed to oral prednisone, which was furthered tapered over the next 12 days. The steroid was used roughly day 4 of admission, and 7 days after symptoms had started, it is hard to tag a response to the steroid separately as the patient was started on both hemodialysis and steroid at the same time after biopsy of kidney confirmed the diagnosis; nevertheless, we were able to see stable improvement on creatinine on days 8 and 9, with improvement of urine output (roughly 1000-1500 cm3/d). The patient stabilized with his creatinine at 3.54 mg/dL before being discharged home and follow-up 8 weeks later showed a normal creatinine.
Renal biopsy () showed normocellular glomeruli, interstitial atrophy, and fibrosis with tubular loss of 10% to 20%. There were foci of interstitial inflammation composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and edema with areas of severe arterioarterosclerosis. No immune complexes were detected.

The patient's serum creatinine level. 2. The patient's baseline creatinine level. 3. The patient's albumin level. The formula for the albumin-corrected delta ratio is: \[ \text{ACDR} = \frac{\text{Change in Creatinine}}{\text{Albumin}} \] The change in creatinine is the difference between the current creatinine level and the baseline creatinine level. From the patient note: - The current creatinine level is 10.48 mg/dL. - The baseline creatinine level from 3 years prior is 1.15 mg/dL. - The albumin level is 3.8 g/dL. Now, let's calculate the change in creatinine: \[ \text{Change in Creatinine} = \text{Current Creatinine} - \text{Baseline Creatinine} = 10.48 \, \text{mg/dL} - 1.15 \, \text{mg/dL} = 9.33 \, \text{mg/dL}. \] Now, we can calculate the ACDR using the formula: \[ \text{ACDR} = \frac{\text{Change in Creatinine}}{\text{Albumin}} = \frac{9.33 \, \text{mg/dL}}{3.8 \, \text{g/dL}}. \] Perform the division: \[ \text{ACDR} = \frac{9.33}{3.8} \approx 2.455. \] Rounded to two decimal places, the ACDR is approximately 2.46. So the step-by-step thinking process is as follows: 1. Identify the current creatinine level: 10.48 mg/dL. 2. Identify the baseline creatinine level: 1.15 mg/dL. 3. Calculate the change in creatinine: \(10.48 - 1.15 = 9.33 \, \text{mg/dL}.\) 4. Identify the albumin level: 3.8 g/dL. 5. Use the formula for ACDR: \(\text{ACDR} = \frac{\text{Change in Creatinine}}{\text{Albumin}} = \frac{9.33}{3.8}.\) 6. Perform the division to get the ACDR: \(\frac{9.33}{3.8} \approx 2.455.\) 7. Round the result to two decimal places: approximately 2.46. Thus, the albumin-corrected delta ratio is approximately 2.46.

The FeverPAIN score is used to assess the severity of a child's illness and is based on the following components: - Fever - Pain - Airway compromise - Inflammation - Neurological symptoms Each component is scored, and the total score helps determine the severity and management of the condition. Let's break it down step-by-step using the information provided in the patient note. Step 1: Evaluate the Fever component. The patient has a temperature of 39.6°C, which indicates a high fever. Step 2: Evaluate the Pain component. The patient presents with symptoms such as drooling, inability to eat solids, and hoarseness, which suggest pain or discomfort, likely related to the throat and possibly the neck. Step 3: Evaluate the Airway compromise component. The patient has symptoms like loud snoring, noisy breathing, and hoarseness. These symptoms suggest some degree of airway compromise. Step 4: Evaluate the Inflammation component. The patient has enlarged tonsils with mild erythema and white exudates, multiple anterior cervical lymph nodes that are mobile, nonerythematous, and nontender, and laboratory findings showing a white blood cell count of 14.2 × 10^3/µL (with 37% neutrophils and 52% lymphocytes), and a C-reactive protein level of 17.17 mg/dL, indicating inflammation. Step 5: Evaluate the Neurological symptoms component. There are no reported neurological symptoms such as neck stiffness, altered mental status, or other neurological findings. Now let's assign scores to each component based on the FeverPAIN scoring system: - **Fever**: The patient has a fever of 39.6°C. Typically, a fever above 39°C is considered high. Let's assign a score of 1 for fever. - **Pain**: The patient has symptoms like drooling, inability to eat solids, and hoarseness, suggesting significant pain or discomfort. Let's assign a score of 1 for pain. - **Airway compromise**: The presence of loud snoring, noisy breathing, and hoarseness indicates some degree of airway compromise. Let's assign a score of 1 for airway compromise. - **Inflammation**: The patient has enlarged tonsils with exudates, elevated WBC count, and elevated CRP, indicating significant inflammation. Let's assign a score of 1 for inflammation. - **Neurological symptoms**: There are no reported neurological symptoms. Let's assign a score of 0 for neurological symptoms. Now, we sum up the scores from each component: Fever = 1 Pain = 1 Airway compromise = 1 Inflammation = 1 Neurological symptoms = 0 Total FeverPAIN score = 1 (Fever) + 1 (Pain) + 1 (Airway compromise) + 1 (Inflammation) + 0 (Neurological symptoms) = 4.

{'Row Number': 452, 'Calculator Name': 'FeverPAIN Score for Strep Pharyngitis', 'Calculator ID': '33', 'Category': 'diagnosis', 'Note ID': 'pmc-5661752-1', 'Patient Note': 'A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is evaluated for a 3-day history of fever and swelling on both sides of his neck. He was found to have acute otitis media and was started on amoxicillin by his pediatrician. Since 2 days ago, the patient presents drooling, loud snoring, noisy breathing, hoarseness, inability to eat solids, and persistence of fever. There is no history of rash, weight loss, night sweats, neck stiffness, sick contacts, recent travel, or exposure to animals.\nPhysical examination reveals an alert, sick-looking child. His temperature is 39.6°C, heart rate is 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, blood pressure is 96/54 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. He has nasal congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with mild erythema, and white exudates. The uvula is not deviated. There are multiple 2- to 3-cm mobile, nonerythematous, nontender anterior cervical lymph nodes bilaterally. The remainder of his physical findings is unremarkable.\nHis initial laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL (126 g/L); white blood cell count of 14.2 × 103/µL (14.2 × 109/L) with 37% neutrophils, 52% lymphocytes; and platelet count of 208 × 103/µL (208 × 109/L). His serum electrolyte values are within normal range. His aspartate transaminase level is 38 U/L, alanine transaminase level is 50 U/L, and C-reactive protein level is 17.17 mg/dL. Rapid strep test is negative. A neck ultrasound () reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging from 1.8 to 3.6 cm over the right subauricular and left subauricular regions without fluid collection. Neck computed tomography without contrast () ruled out any retropharyngeal mass and confirmed level II and level V lymphadenopathy.\nThe patient is admitted and additional tests reveal the diagnosis.', 'Question': "What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?", 'LLM Answer': '4', 'LLM Explanation': 'To calculate the FeverPAIN score, we evaluate the following components: Fever, Pain, Airway compromise, Inflammation, and Neurological symptoms. \\n\\n1. **Fever**: The patient has a temperature of 39.6°C, which indicates a high fever. Assign a score of 1 for fever.\\n2. **Pain**: The patient presents with symptoms such as drooling, inability to eat solids, and hoarseness, suggesting significant pain or discomfort. Assign a score of 1 for pain.\\n3. **Airway compromise**: The presence of loud snoring, noisy breathing, and hoarseness indicates some degree of airway compromise. Assign a score of 1 for airway compromise.\\n4. **Inflammation**: The patient has enlarged tonsils with exudates, elevated WBC count, and elevated CRP, indicating significant inflammation. Assign a score of 1 for inflammation.\\n5. **Neurological symptoms**: There are no reported neurological symptoms. Assign a score of 0 for neurological symptoms.\\n\\nNow, sum up the scores: \\nFever = 1\\nPain = 1\\nAirway compromise = 1\\nInflammation = 1\\nNeurological symptoms = 0\\n\\nTotal FeverPAIN score = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4.', 'LLM Thinking': 'No Thoughts', 'Ground Truth Answer': '3', 'Ground Truth Explanation': "The patient's current FeverPain score is 0.\n'The patient is reported to have a fever in the past 24 hours and so we increment the score by 1, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient is reported to not have an absence of cough or coryza and so we do not increment the score, keeping the current total at 1.\n'The patient is reported to have a symptom onset ≤3 days and so we increment the score by 1, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.\n'The patient is reported to have purulent tonsils and so we increment the score by 1, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.\nThe patient is reported to not have severe tonsil inflammation and so we do not increment the score, keeping the current total at 3.\nThe patient's FeverPain score is 3 points.", 'Result': 'Incorrect'}
