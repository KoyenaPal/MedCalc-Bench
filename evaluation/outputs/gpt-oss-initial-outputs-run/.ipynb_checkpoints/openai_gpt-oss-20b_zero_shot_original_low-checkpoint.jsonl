Need risk factors: age, total cholesterol, HDL, systolic BP, treatment for hypertension, smoking status, diabetes. We have LDL 107 mg/dL, HDL 43 mg/dL. But Framingham uses total cholesterol, not LDL. We don't have total cholesterol. We have LDL, HDL, triglycerides. We could approximate total cholesterol? Not given. We might need to assume typical? But maybe we can compute using available data? The question likely expects to compute using Framingham risk score formula. But we lack total cholesterol. Maybe we can use LDL as total? That would be wrong. But maybe the exam expects to use LDL as total? Unlikely. Alternatively, maybe we can compute using the Framingham 10-year risk score for coronary heart disease using the online calculator. But we need total cholesterol. Could we derive total cholesterol from LDL and HDL? Using Friedewald: TC = LDL + HDL + (TG/5). TG=98 mg/dL, TG/5=19.6. So TC = 107 + 43 + 19.6 = 169.6 mg/dL. That seems plausible. So total cholesterol ~170 mg/dL. Good. Now we need systolic BP: 131 mmHg. Not on antihypertensive. Smoking: 3-pack year, but current? He is a smoker? He had 3-pack year history, but not current? He had 3-pack year smoking history. That suggests he smoked in past but not currently? The phrase \"3-pack year smoking history\" could mean he smoked 3 packs per year? Actually \"3-pack year\" means 3 pack-years, which is a cumulative measure. It doesn't specify current smoking. Usually if they say \"3-pack year smoking history\" they mean he has smoked in the past but not necessarily currently. But risk factor: current smoker? If not current, then not a risk factor. But we can assume he is a current smoker? The phrase \"3-pack year smoking history\" is ambiguous. But likely he is a current smoker? But 3 pack-year is low. But risk factor: yes. We'll assume current smoker. Diabetes: none. So we have: Age 50, total cholesterol 170, HDL 43, systolic BP 131, not on HTN treatment, smoker, no diabetes. Now we need to compute Framingham risk score points. Use the Framingham risk score for men.

For age 50-54, the points for total cholesterol: - <160: 0 - 160-199: 1 - 200-239: 2 - 240-279: 3 - >=280: 4 Our TC 170 => 1 point. HDL points: - >=60: -1 - 50-59: 0 - 40-49: 1 - 30-39: 2 - <30: 3 HDL 43 => 1 point. Systolic BP points (if untreated): - <120: 0 - 120-129: 1 - 130-139: 2 - 140-159: 3 - >=160: 4 SBP 131 => 2 points. If treated, different points, but not treated. Smoking points: - For men: current smoker: 2 points. Diabetes: none. Now sum points: Age 8 + TC 1 + HDL 1 + SBP 2 + smoking 2 = 14 points. Now convert points to 10-year risk percentage. For men, points to risk: Points: 0-4: <1% 5-6: 1% 7-8: 2% 9-10: 3% 11-12: 5% 13-14: 6% 15-16: 8% 17-18: 10% 19-20: 12% 21-22: 16% 23-24: 20% 25-26: 25% 27-28: 30% 29-30: 35% 31-32: 40% 33-34: 45% 35-36: 50% Our points 14 => 6% 10-year risk.

The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 131.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 107.0 mg. To convert 107.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 107.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.107 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.107 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000277 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000277 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000277 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.277 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.277 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 107.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 2.77 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 43.0 mg. To convert 43.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.043 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.043 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000111 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000111 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.111 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 43.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.11 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(50) + 20.014077 * ln(2.77) + -0.905964 * ln(1.11) + 1.305784 * ln(131.0) + 0.241549 * 0  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(50) * ln(2.77) + -2.84367 * ln(50) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(50) * ln(50) -  172.300168 = -4.4.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-4.4) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Need to assign chronic health points: For chronic health conditions: chronic liver disease: 5 points? Let's recall: APACHE II chronic health points: 5 for severe organ insufficiency (e.g., severe liver disease). For immunocompromised? Not sure. But typical: 5 for severe organ insufficiency, 4 for severe immunocompromise? Actually APACHE II chronic health points: 5 for severe organ insufficiency (e.g., severe liver disease, severe heart disease, severe renal disease). 4 for severe immunocompromise. 3 for severe chronic disease. 2 for mild. 0 for none. So we might assign 5 for liver failure and 4 for immunocompromise? But maybe only one category? Usually you add points for each condition? I think you add points for each condition, but maximum 5? Wait: In APACHE II, chronic health points: 5 for severe organ insufficiency, 4 for severe immunocompromise, 3 for severe chronic disease, 2 for mild chronic disease, 0 for none. But you only add one set of points based on the most severe condition. So we choose 5 for severe organ insufficiency (liver failure). So chronic health points = 5. Now we need to compute acute physiology score: 12 variables: temperature, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygenation (PaO2 or A-a gradient?), arterial pH, serum sodium, serum potassium, serum creatinine, hematocrit, white blood cell count. We have many. Let's list values: Temperature: 37.2\u00b0C. Normal 36.8-37.2? Score 0? For APACHE II, temperature: < 36.0 or > 38.5 gets points. 37.2 is normal, so 0. Mean arterial pressure: MAP = (2*diastolic + systolic)/3 = (2*75+135)/3 = (150+135)/3 = 285/3 = 95 mmHg. MAP 95. For MAP 70-100? Score 0. So 0. Heart rate: 95 bpm. HR 90-109? Score 0. So 0. Respiratory rate: 19. RR 12-20? Score 0. So 0. Oxygenation: We have A-a gradient 364 with FiO2 55%. For APACHE II, oxygenation variable is PaO2 (or A-a gradient). Usually use PaO2. But we don't have PaO2. We have A-a gradient. But we can approximate? A-a gradient 364 is high. But APACHE II uses PaO2. If PaO2 not available, maybe use A-a gradient? But typical scoring: PaO2 < 60 mmHg gets 4 points, 60-80 gets 3, 80-100 gets 2, 100-120 gets 1, >120 gets 0. But we don't have PaO2. We have A-a gradient 364. That indicates severe hypoxemia. But we can't compute PaO2. Maybe we approximate that PaO2 is low. But we need a numeric. We could assume PaO2 is low, maybe <60. So assign 4 points. Arterial pH: 7.32. pH 7.30-7.39? Score 0? Actually pH 7.30-7.39 gets 0. pH 7.20-7.29 gets 1, 7.10-7.19 gets 2, <7.10 gets 3. So 7.32 is 0. Serum sodium: 138 mEq/L. Normal 135-145. So 0. Serum potassium: 4.5 mEq/L. Normal 3.5-5.0. So 0. Serum creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL. For creatinine: >3.5 gets 4 points. So 4. Hematocrit: 43%. Normal 38-46. So 0. White blood cell count: 12,000 per \u00b5L. WBC 10,000-19,999 gets 1 point. So 1. So acute physiology score = sum: 0+0+0+0+4+0+0+0+4+0+1 = 9. Now add chronic health points: 5. Total APACHE II = 9+5 = 14. But we might also consider that we used oxygenation incorrectly.

This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 5.200000000000003 = 2.889 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is below 30 degrees Celsius, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total, 6 + 4 = 10.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 75.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 135.0 mm Hg = 95.0 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 95.0 mm Hg.\nBecause the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\nBecause the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10. Because the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level above 3.5, 8 points are added to the score, making the current total 10 + 8 = 18.\nBecause the patient's hemocratit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 18. Because the patient's white blood cell count is above 40 x10^9/L, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total 18 + 4 = 22.\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 14.0, and so we add 14.0 points to the total making the current total 14.0 + 22 = 36.0.

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone.

She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6\u00b0F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.\nPatient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4\u201310.8 \u00d7 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4\u20137.0 \u00d7 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1\u201315.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34\u201346%), platelet 69 (150\u2013450 \u00d7 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6\u201320 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57\u20131.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7\u201310.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2\u20132.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0\u201340 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0\u201332 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15\u201350 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0\u20139 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90\u2013180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10\u201340 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative.

HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations.

Later: \"The value of vitamin D was measured on the day in which renal function was most impaired (creatinine 8mg/dL).\" So at worst, creatinine 8 mg/dL. But we need GFR at that time? The question: \"Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?\" Likely use creatinine 8 mg/dL. Also need age 73, female, African American. MDRD equation: eGFR = 175 \u00d7 (Scr)^-1.154 \u00d7 (Age)^-0.203 \u00d7 (0.742 if female) \u00d7 (1.212 if African American). So compute. Scr = 8 mg/dL. Age = 73. Female. African American. Compute step by step. First, Scr^-1.154: 8^-1.154. Let's compute log10: log10(8)=0.90309. Multiply by -1.154 gives -1.042. So 10^-1.042 = 0.0908. Alternatively compute directly: 8^1.154 = e^(1.154*ln8). ln8=2.07944. 1.154*2.07944=2.400. e^2.400=11.02. So 8^-1.154 = 1/11.02 = 0.0907. Good. Age^-0.203: 73^-0.203. ln73=4.2905. Multiply by -0.203 = -0.871. e^-0.871 = 0.418. Alternatively 73^0.203 = e^(0.203*ln73)=e^(0.871)=2.389. So inverse 1/2.389=0.418. Now multiply: 175 * 0.0907 * 0.418 = 175 * (0.0907*0.418). 0.0907*0.418=0.0379. 175*0.0379=6.63. Now multiply by 0.742 (female) => 6.63*0.742=4.92. Multiply by 1.212 (African American) => 4.92*1.212=5.96. So eGFR \u2248 6 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2. That is extremely low. Thus answer: about 6 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2.

He was comatose with serial fits, and had an acute onset of renal failure for which one session of dialysis was done. His relatives reported an acute onset of disturbed conscious level with serial fits and low grade fever four days earlier. His past medical and drug history were unremarkable.\nAt presentation, he was febrile (temperature 38.0\u00b0C) and hypertensive (blood pressure 170/100 mmHg). Central venous pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg and urine output (UOP) was 100 cc. Otherwise, in general, his neurological examination was normal except for serial fits.\nInitial laboratory tests included a white blood cell count of 13.7 (4.0-11.0 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL) with predominant lymphocytosis, hemoglobin 15.5 (13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelets 200 (150-400 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1003 (20-57 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1200 (21-72 IU/L), total bilirubin 1.1 (0.0-1.5 mg/dL), direct bilirubin 0.6 (0.0-0.8 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 120 (30-136 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1 and prothrombin time 11 (10.0-13.5 s), serum albumin 4 (3.5-6 mg/dL), random blood sugar 250 (140-199 mg/dL), creatinine 10 (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), urea 330 (15-45 mg/dL), Na+ 136 (135-145 mmol/L), K+ 3.6 (3.5-5), and calcium 9 (9-11 mg/dL). For acute hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HB core antibody, and HCV-antibodies by third generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as HIV-antibodies, serologies were negative. Also, an autoimmune screen, anti-double stranded DNA, pANCA and cANCA, anti-nuclear antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were all negative. A surface echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 75-80.\nSerum, liver and renal biochemistry was normal 4 days earlier (AST 32 IU/L, ALT 40 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL) when the patient was admitted to the fever hospital. He was receiving ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously every 24 hours, phenytoin 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and paracetamol 0.5 g every 6 hours.\nAn abdominopelvic ultrasound was unremarkable, and chest X-ray was normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast revealed mild brain edema (Figure ), magnetic resonance imaging revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ), and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed an encephalitic pattern (Figure ). Cerebrospinal fluid examination returned the following results: glucose 160 mg/dL, protein 20 (20-40 mg/dL), chlorides 717 (720-750 mg/dL), and cells 70/mm3, which were mainly lymphocytes.\nSerology tests were negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, enterovirus, and antistreptolysin O titer (ASOT). A serology test for EBV by PCR was also negative. A serology test for CMV confirmed acute infection, with a 10-fold rise in CMV-specific IgM. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for (CMV) was also positive in the serum and the CSF.\nBecause of the impaired renal function, the patient was started on acyclovir 10 mg/day. Lamotrigine was chosen as antiepileptic drug as it is safe to use in patients with elevated liver enzymes, in addition to other supportive measures such as glycerol as a cerebral dehydrating measure, and antibiotics.\nOver the next three days, fits were controlled. On the third day, the patient started to regain consciousness and became fully conscious by day 11. Renal function returned to normal (without dialysis) after 17 days. Liver enzymes returned to normal after 20 days. A follow-up EEG revealed no abnormality (Figure ).

Identify the measured serum sodium: 136 mmol/L (within normal range). 2. Recognize that the patient has hyperglycemia (glucose 250 mg/dL), which can lower the measured sodium (pseudohyponatremia). 3.

Actually sodium is 136 mmol/L, which is within normal range (135-145). But maybe they want corrected sodium for hyponatremia due to hyperglycemia? The serum glucose is 250 mg/dL. Hyperglycemia causes pseudohyponatremia. Correction formula: corrected Na = measured Na + 0.024*(glucose-100) mg/dL? Wait typical correction: For every 100 mg/dL increase in glucose above 100 mg/dL, add 1.6 mEq/L to Na. Some use 1.6 mEq/L per 100 mg/dL. So glucose 250 mg/dL: difference 150 mg/dL. 150/100 = 1.5 * 1.6 = 2.4 mEq/L. So corrected Na = 136 + 2.4 = 138.4 mEq/L. Alternatively use 1.6 per 100 mg/dL. So answer 138.4 mEq/L. Provide step-by-step.", "Ground Truth Answer": "139.6", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.\nThe concentration of sodium is 136.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 136.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 136.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 136.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 250.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (250.0 - 100) = 139.6 mEq/L.\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 139.6 mEq/L.", "Result": "Correct"}
